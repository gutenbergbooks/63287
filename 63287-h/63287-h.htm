  <h2 class='c009'>────────────────<br />CHAPTER I <span class='small'>◆</span> FALSE STARTS<br />────────────────</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>At the time of my mother’s death some fifteen
years ago, we found among her cherished possessions
a soiled and tattered old manuscript written
in a scrawling school-boy hand, and inscribed in her
neat and graceful lettering—“Owen’s first play, when
he was just nine years old.” This opus bore the somewhat
violent title of <span class='fss'>DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND OR THE
RIVAL DETECTIVES</span> and upon reading it over I was struck
by one marked originality—toward the end of the first
act only one of the characters remained alive, and as
the final curtain fell he committed suicide. I had
reached some degree of success long before my
mother’s death, and, once or twice, when some friend
spoke of one of my plays as “the best thing I ever
wrote,” I noticed a somewhat scornful smile on her
sensitive lips. She had all of the reticence of the
true Yankee and, secure in her possession of the only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>copy of <span class='fss'>DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND</span>, she could afford to
smile.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a matter of truth, she smiled more frequently
than one would expect of the mother of eight children,
and her strong and dauntless ambition saw no limits
at all to the future of her brood. To those who knew
her there is no mystery in the fact that a boy of nine,
born in a country town many years before the talking
pictures had brought the drama to every hamlet in
the world, should have been born with the trick of
creating dramatic narrative and the fierce longing to
create it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bangor, Maine, in the early 80’s knew little of the
theater. I may have seen <span class='fss'>UNCLE TOM’S CABIN</span>, Edwin
Booth, Joe Jefferson and possibly one or two others,
for in those days New York had no monopoly, our
great actors played everywhere—but the theater
meant less than nothing to my father and little more
to any member of our community.</p>

<p>Owen Davis when he entered Harvard in 1889</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I had been born, however, with the smell of the
stage in my nostrils and was as stage-struck before I
ever saw a stage as I am to-day after almost thirty-five
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>years, during which I have seen very little else and
have bitterly resented the few hours I have passed in
any other atmosphere.</p>
<div id='i016'  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i016.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p>“Aside from being a fair football player and a very fast hundred-yard sprinter, I did little to distinguish myself.” Winning the 100-yard dash at Harvard in May, 1891.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>This hunger for the glamorous and the romantic
surely did not come to me from the staid New England
farmers and lawyers whose lives had been devoted
to the stern necessity of grubbing an existence out of
the rather stubborn soil of Maine and Vermont; but,
on my mother’s side there were certain bold Yanks
who had sailed the seas on some of the clipper ships
that in those days were built and manned along the
coast of Maine. To my mother then, and through
her to some adventurer of the deep, I owe the fact
that I have never in my life wanted to do, and in
truth I never have done, any of the practical, humdrum
work of this extremely practical world, but have
remained perfectly content to make faces at life and
earn my living by drawing pictures on the wall.</p>

<p class='c013'>If I am right in my opinion that these bad habits
of mine came to me from my mother, I must absolve
her from the blame of not handing me at the same
time some of her own stern pains to repress them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Whatever her dreams had been, her realities were
practical enough and she was one of the many victims
of one of life’s modest ironies—a woman who gave
so much of herself that the future of her eight children
should be what she wanted it to be that she died, still
fighting, instead of ever sharing in the success we owe
so greatly to her.</p>

<p class='c013'>Success in life is a difficult thing to estimate. My
mother, I am afraid, had little of the thrill of romantic
adventure that I knew her spirit craved. Indeed,
so far as I know, she had no time and no desire to
think of herself at all, and she died before she could
be sure that her ambitions for her children would
ever be satisfied. Yet I think she was a successful
woman.</p>

<p class='c013'>My recollections of these days, stimulated by this
message in her faded handwriting, vaguely recall a
long line of literary monstrosities of about the same
date, and when my own boys, at about some such
absurd age, showed symptoms of having been bitten
by some wandering bacteria of the drama, I had an
advantage over my father and at once recognized the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>symptoms. Like other dread diseases I knew this
one to be incurable, the only treatment being to give
the patient plenty of nourishing food, against the time
when he will have difficulty in getting it for himself,
keep him as cheerful as possible, and hope for the
worst.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the time of my first offense I was a member
of a flourishing Dramatic Society and I have a very
distinct memory of my rage when at length the worms
turned and one of my fellow members arose at a
meeting and firmly moved the chair that in future
the club devote its energies to performing plays written
by some one besides Owen Davis. This was my
first experience of dramatic criticism; my second came
some fifteen years later, fifteen years during which I
am afraid I had drifted away from the worship of
the drama and directed myself with equal enthusiasm
to playing ball with such rare and occasional intervals
of study as seemed necessary to preserve the peace.</p>

<p class='c013'>The theater seemed very far away. My father at
that time was the president of the Society of American
Iron Manufacturers and had a small furnace at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Kathodin Iron Works, a settlement in the Maine
woods about fifty miles above Bangor; and after considerable
conflict I was persuaded by my father that
I had the makings in me of a great mining engineer.
If I had not already stated that my sense of humor
came to me from my mother’s side, this would be a
good place to bring it in.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I was about fifteen, my father’s business took
him to the Cumberland Mountains in the southern
part of Kentucky and he took my mother and the
younger children with him, sending my elder brother
to Massachusetts Tech and me to Harvard. In 1889
there was no School of the Drama in Harvard, but I
can’t recall that there was any great yearning on my
part for one. For some queer reason the memory of
the years I spent there is vague and shadowy. I was
not old enough at the time to get the benefits of a
great university, and, aside from the fact of being
a fair football player and a very fast hundred-yard
sprinter, I did little to distinguish myself.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was a wretched scholar; neither at that time nor
at any other have I ever been able to do anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>unless it happened to be the one thing I wanted to do,
and I can’t recall that a high grade in any of my
studies was at any time one of my ambitions. I went
to the Boston theaters whenever I had money enough
to get there and I saw all of the great plays and all of
the actors of the day, but I worshiped them from a
distance and had long ago ceased to hope that my
life could in any way be devoted to anything aside
from mining engineering. But as I have never been
able to understand the simplest scientific problem and
still retain a bland uncertainty as to how many times
three goes in nine, I doubt if the engineering profession
lost much when I later reverted to type.</p>

<p class='c013'>My only adventure in the theater during these
years was as a member of what was called “The
Society of Arts” which was, I think, the very first
art group to undertake to elevate the drama in America.
For some reason I have a perfectly distinct recollection
of this weighty and august group, although I
can’t for the life of me remember what I was doing
in it. The society was organized by Harvard professors
and the distinguished group of men of letters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>who at that time brought glory to Cambridge and
Boston.</p>

<p class='c013'>A large sum of money was raised, a fine company
of actors engaged, and a month’s rental of the Hollis
Street Theatre, Boston, secured. We produced four
plays, not written by ordinary playwrights but the
product of real literary masters; one by William Dean
Howells, one by Frank R. Stockton and the others
by famous writers of equal standing. The company
was headed by Maurice Barrymore and his wife, and
everything was done to attract the “lovers of a better
drama” in Boston. But the “lovers of a better drama”
in Boston were as scarce in 1890 as they are to-day,
and the venture was never a success.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It was a long time ago and my memory is vague
as to the merits of our performances, but I do recall
one passing comment. Toward the end of the third
week the head usher came to me with the news that
“all the ushers have quit, and I don’t know what we’ll
do about showing people to their seats, if there are any
people to show to their seats.” I asked him the reason
for this sudden desertion on the part of our ushers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>he informed me curtly that “they couldn’t stand the
—— —— shows!”</p>

<p class='c013'>I don’t remember that I greatly mourned the passing
of America’s first art group in the theater and I
loafed along pleasantly enough during my years in
Cambridge, winning some glory on the running track
and trying to make up for my lack of age and weight,
both of which at that time told heavily against me
on the football field. By some odd freak I took few
of the courses in English and wrote nothing at all,
my only advance in any of the fine arts being a training
as a draw-poker player, an accomplishment I have
never ceased to be grateful for to the great university
where I secured so solid and lasting a technique.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was tremendously influenced at this time by
Phillips Brooks, who still stands in my memory as
the greatest American I have ever known, and I grew
so fond of Professor N. S. Shaler, a grand figure both
as a man and a scientist, that I took every one of his
courses in paleontology without ever gaining the most
remote idea of what they were all about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Quite without ambition and with no definite objective
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>at all I drifted along until, in the summer of
1903, I found myself working for a coal mining company
in which my father was interested, in the Cumberland
Mountains. I was even a worse mining engineer
than I had ever hoped to be and was extravagantly
overpaid by my salary of forty dollars a month. I
am sure that I, at the time, never considered myself
worth any more, but I found it difficult to save out of
that forty a month a sum of money large enough to
gratify the first great ambition of my life. It came to
me suddenly, the very day I went to work in the coal
business and consisted of a deep determination to get
out of it with the least possible delay.</p>

<p class='c013'>Aside from the fact that the glamorous title of a
mining engineer turned out to be just another name
for a guy who dug holes in the ground, I simply detested
the dirty little southern town in which I found
myself. Also, as I happened to start my work on the
very day the Debs strike started, I added fear for my
life to my other reason for a prompt withdrawal.
There I had to remain, however, all during the riots
and shootings and murders of the great strike, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>town I lived in was sometimes held by the strikers,
and sometimes by the Kentucky State Troops. On
occasion both sides were forced to withdraw for a time,
as this part of the mountains had long been reserved
as a battleground by the Hatfield and McCoy factions,
whose feud, arising out of the fact that some young
lady of the generation before had looked funny in a
hoop skirt, had resulted in the death, with their boots
on, of many more worthy citizens than the entire
population of the town in my day. Being even then
of a strictly impersonal nature, I didn’t in the least
care whether the McCoys killed the Hatfields or
the strikers killed the state troops. It didn’t seem
to be my party. All I wanted was a ticket to New
York.</p>

<p class='c013'>I knew that I could expect no help from my father.
He had, for the moment, lost all of his money. It
was his habit to make and lose considerable fortunes
with the rapidity and nonchalance of a Wilkins
Micawber, and this was one of the times when, like
Micawber, he was waiting for something to turn up.
My father was, I am sure, the sweetest and gentlest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and one of the ablest men I have ever known—and
I am equally sure he was the worst business man. I
don’t know how many months it took me to save
the railroad fare to New York, but I know that I
arrived there in due time with exactly twelve dollars
in my pocket and a firm determination to conquer the
theater, either as a writer or as an actor.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was indifferent. Let fate decide. Fate, however,
had pretty well decided as I was never, as we
say in Hollywood, “just the type” for romantic juveniles,
having always been about the same distance
around as I was up and down, and so I made a final
decision to attack as a dramatist. And when I say
that in the thirty odd years since then I have had more
fun than any man in the world, I am prepared to
defend my boast against doubters either on foot or on
horseback. If life has taught me anything at all, it is
that round pegs belong in round holes and that the
one great happiness is to be doing the thing one loves
to do.</p>

<p class='c012'>Twelve dollars is not a large capital for an unknown
boy, quite without friends, thrown upon his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>own resources in New York, and I am willing to
admit that at fifty-six I should scream with terror at
what at twenty-two seemed to me to be a glorious
adventure.</p>

<p class='c013'>A. M. Palmer was at that time one of the leading
New York managers and after many attempts I succeeded
in persuading him to read a play I had written.
Fortunately no copy of this drama remains in existence.
It was, according to my vague memory, a very
terrible affair. But Mr. Palmer, who was a sort of
Christopher Columbus of his time, seemed to discover
in it some germ of promise, and as in spite of some
months of experience I still found it difficult to live
without eating, he offered to make me an actor until
such time as I was able to live by writing. He put me
with an all-star cast supporting Madame Janauschek,
the last of the really great tragic actors of the romantic
school.</p>

<p class='c013'>This company contained such well-known artists
as Blanche Walsh, W. H. Thompson, Annie Yeamans,
Fred Bond, Orin Johnstone, Joseph Whiting, George
C. Boniface, Sr., and many others, and opened in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>rather a bad melodrama called <span class='fss'>THE GREAT DIAMOND
ROBBERY</span>, a vehicle quite unworthy of the really great
talents of Janauschek who was, in some ways, the
finest actress I have ever known. She had been a
friend of the very great in Europe, and had come
so near to being an actual queen that much of the
manner of royalty still clung to her. When I knew
her she was short and dumpy and old but in her
presence one had the feeling of the latent power and
fire of this remarkable woman and a sense of the pity
and irony of her slow decay.</p>

<p class='c013'>My duties as a member of her company had at
least the spice of variety, as I played five parts in the
play, was assistant stage manager and had the added
privilege of sitting at the gallery door for an hour
before each performance to count the number of persons
who entered, as it was a playful custom of the
day for the owner of the theater to sell about twice as
many gallery tickets as were found in the box when
the count was made. For these duties I was rewarded
by the rather small salary of twelve dollars a week,
and although twelve dollars went further in those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>days than they do now, they never seemed quite to
reach from one Saturday night to the next one.</p>

<p class='c013'>I played with this company for its run in New
York and continued with it for a long road season.
The road in those days took in all of the principal
towns of the country and, as Janauschek was an established
favorite, we did a good business everywhere.
My twelve dollars a week that probably wouldn’t pay
for a room to-day was with a little stretching enough
for a decent living, although by the end of each week
I was driven to borrowing the morning papers for the
want of the two cents necessary to purchase them.</p>

<p class='c013'>At that time one could live for a week at the second
best hotel in any city for ten dollars and a half, room,
bath and food. Ten dollars and a half, however, was
far beyond me and I usually found possible enough
accommodations for about eight dollars. The company
made many night journeys, but, as I remember
it, the expense of sleeping-car berths never worried me.
I solved that problem by turning up the collar of my
coat, resting my head on my shabby old suit case and
stretching myself out on two seats of a smoking car.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>I had seen little of the country at that time and each
new town we came to was a fresh adventure. I loved
the life and from the first I never had a doubt but
what it was to be mine for the rest of my life. I was
sincere in my ambition to become a playwright and at
the close of the season I struck out boldly toward that
goal. The fact that I was inclined to decide upon
play writing rather than acting may have been partly
influenced by a parting scene I had with Madame
Janauschek the last day of our season.</p>

<p class='c013'>Janauschek had been extremely kind to me in her
rather queeny way and summoned me to her presence
at her apartments in one of the great Chicago hotels
for a word of parting and advice. After a few formal
words in her broken English she presented me with a
small photograph of herself on which she had written
a gracious message in her native German. She then
led me to the door, kissed me firmly on the forehead
and said: “Young man—neffer again be an actor,”
and pushed me out into the hall and closed the door.</p>

<p class='c013'>The closing of the season and some inward agreement
with Madame’s verdict ended my attempts at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>acting except for one or two occasions when I was
forced by some great emergency to jump into some
part to save a performance and one dreadful time, of
which I will speak later, when stern necessity seemed
to be facing me. Two of the occasions when I had
to become an actor or close a theater are fresh in my
memory.</p>

<p class='c013'>During its second season my play <span class='fss'>THROUGH THE
BREAKERS</span> was booked to open in Jersey City with a
holiday matinée. Unfortunately the worst blizzard of
twenty years had been raging and at matinée time
several of the company had been unable to cross the
river. I was the company manager and after switching
the cast about as much as possible I found that the
only way to give a performance at all was for me
to go on and play the part of the rough and villainous
sailor. Reluctantly I decided to go through with it,
and did so to the best of my ability. By evening the
storm was over and the company were all on hand
and, during the extremely melodramatic second act I
stood in the rear of the darkened theater and watched
the performance. It was just at the height of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>villainous sailor’s most villainous moment when the
head usher, who happened to be beside me, whispered:
“That ain’t the same man who played the old sailor
this afternoon.” “No,” I answered, “it isn’t.” “I
thought it wasn’t,” replied the usher, “seems to me
he’s a damned sight better.”</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>The other occasion of which I wrote—and, come
to think of it, my last appearance as an actor on any
stage—was in a musical comedy I concocted about
twenty-five years ago for John C. Rice and Sally
Cohen, then and for many years afterwards favorite
entertainers of vaudeville and musical comedy. Saturday
night of the first week of the play John Rice
came to me and in a hoarse whisper informed me he
had completely lost his voice, a fact that was only too
evident to any one who witnessed his distress in trying
to speak above a whisper. The house was sold out
and I owned a third of the show, so it required very
little persuasion from the local theater manager to induce
me to take a chance. Sally Cohen was, I think,
the first to propose that I take her famous husband’s
part, and I distinctly recall that the only thing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>prevented John Rice from absolutely forbidding it was
the fact that by that time he was quite incapable of
making any sound at all and could only protest by
frantic signs and facial contortions.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>At first the fact that Rice was one of the greatest
dancers living and that he had six songs to sing rather
dampened my confidence, not only because I didn’t
know either the songs or the dance steps, but because
I never sang a song or danced a step in my life. Little
obstacles, however, never troubled me in those days,
and although I was three inches shorter and fifty
pounds heavier than Rice I calmly arrayed myself in
his opening costume and rang the curtain up. About
all I remember of that night is that we got the money,
although for years afterwards whenever I chanced to
meet that local manager he fell into a violent fit of
laughter, the cause of which he was never satisfactorily
able to explain.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>────────────────<br />CHAPTER II <span class='small'>◆</span> SELLING THE FIRST ONE<br />────────────────</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Although I am rambling about a little ahead of
my story the reader will have observed that by
this time I had crossed the Rubicon and had sold my
first play and was steaming ahead at full speed. Very
few weeks pass during which I am not asked “how to
sell a first play” and for the benefit of all would-be
dramatists I propose to pause here and answer this
question for all time by giving a brief description of
how I sold mine.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had no money at all and absolutely no idea of who
the managers were or how to approach them, but I
had a play, or at least I had an amazing number of
perfectly good words neatly set down on paper, and
I started boldly out on my quest. This quest proved
as it almost always does an unbelievably long and
difficult one. Luck favored me by bringing about a
chance meeting on Broadway with an old friend, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>captain of the Harvard varsity football team on which
I had been a substitute, and through him I managed
to land the job of coaching the football squad of a
New York prep school at a salary of fifty dollars a
month. So the food and shelter problem was solved
for the next few months. But all good things, even
football seasons, come to an end, and before I had
discovered, first, that no one would read my play,
and, second, that it was absolutely not worth reading
anyway, I had some hard knocks and some rather dire
experiences. At length I made up my mind that
possibly the reason I couldn’t sell my play was because
it was a bad one and I started another, but stern necessity
was knocking hard and loud and in a moment
of discouragement I made up my mind to again become
an actor. A kind Providence, however, saved
me from this fate, although at the moment I was
tempted to doubt its kindness.</p>

<p class='c013'>I wrote a letter to the late James O’Neill, who as
usual was rehearsing his company at his home in New
London; some mention of my experience at Harvard
caught O’Neill’s eye and he wrote me to join the company
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>at New London, but he evidently did not think
it necessary to enclose transportation to a worthy Harvard
graduate. I arrived in New London one beautiful
August day in 1898 or thereabouts with a capital
of ninety cents, and was asked by Mr. O’Neill to memorize
six parts in the various plays he was to do that
season, and to read one of them, the part of the juvenile
lead in <span class='fss'>VIRGINIOS</span> to him the following morning.
To this day when things are breaking very badly for
me I am haunted by some of these terrible lines:
“Spread the news in every corner of the city, and let
no man who calls himself a son of Rome stand aside
when tyranny assails its fairest daughter.” O’Neill
listened to my reading of the part and swallowed hard
and remarked that “I still needed a little work,” and
then made me the princely offer of twenty dollars a
week for the season if I would buy seven hundred and
fifty dollars’ worth of costumes for the parts. At that
it was my turn to swallow hard as my ninety cents
had shrunk considerably during the last twenty-four
hours, but I managed to stammer out that I’d think it
over and let him know.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Mr. O’Neill went into town to spend the evening
leaving me seated on a rock busy with a mathematical
problem, and as I never was a great mathematician I
sat there on that rock until twelve o’clock that night
trying to figure out how to expand the remains of my
ninety cents to cover seven hundred and fifty dollars
for costumes and enough over to live on for five weeks
before my salary was to start. It was a difficult problem,
but I still think if I had been given a little more
time I would have solved it. I was interrupted, however,
by the sound of voices approaching in the night.
Mr. O’Neill’s home was in a secluded spot. On one
side of it ran the raised tracks of the New Haven railroad.
In the house at that moment young Eugene
O’Neill was sleeping in his crib. At the sound of
voices I looked up, my problem still unsolved. Its
solution came very suddenly. Mr. O’Neill, returning
along the raised railroad tracks, stubbed his toe and
fell through an open culvert and landed at my feet
with both his legs broken. I left New London the
next day. I have often been back since that night,
but my watch is still there.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>Had I known as much in those days as I now know
of the enormous difficulties ahead of me it is possible
that I might have feared them, but at the time my
confidence was more developed than my prudence
and I had no fear at all. This is, of course, the usual
attitude of youth. The obstacles ahead that
seem like mountains to the experience of middle
age are only mole hills to a young man of twenty
odd who quite expects to leap over them without a
change of stride.</p>

<p class='c013'>Yet I doubt if any undertaking in the world is any
more difficult than that of one who elects to make a
living as a dramatist. He must win his place and then
he must hold it, and of the two the last is really the
most difficult. The late Charles Kline told me just
before his death that the most pitiful thing in the
world was a playwright who had written a big success
and learned enough of the difficulties of doing it to
feel absolutely convinced that there wasn’t the slightest
chance of his ever being able to do it again. Every
young playwright must put up with a number of
things that cut deep into a sensitive nature and leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>scars that never quite die away. Many men and
women of talent, who might have developed into fine
writers for the theater find themselves too sensitive for
the harsh contacts and give up in despair. The hours
of waiting in managers’ offices, ignored and unwelcome,
the contemptuous acceptance of plays to be read
that are ultimately glanced over by an office boy and
scornfully rejected, are all a part of the game.</p>

<p class='c013'>I took one of my first plays to the Frohman office.
What happened to it there was, or at least I thought
it was, a matter of life or death to me. I had no money
at all and during the five weeks I was waiting for a
verdict I sold what few clothes I had left, piece by
piece, to pay my three dollars a week room rent and
spent thirty cents a day for food. At last I was ushered
into the presence of the play reader, later one of the
great men of the theater, who met me with this encouraging
speech: “You are,” he said, “a strong and
husky young man, with, so I have heard, some reputation
as an athlete. Why don’t you take this play of
yours and see how far you can throw it?” This was
hardly a tactful rejection, and as it turned out rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>a silly one, as the play in question some years later
made a very reasonable success.</p>

<p class='c013'>One must be prepared for this sort of thing and
resolute enough to thrive on it, as success very rarely
comes upon a young playwright very suddenly. It
doesn’t sneak up behind one and thrust fame and
fortune into one’s lap, fame and fortune being very
timid birds, more likely to fall into the lap of the one
who goes out after them with a gun than to the
dreamer who sits at home and waits patiently. In my
experience patient waiting never got anybody anything.
All the prizes worth having are for the daring—the
one who sits and waits never got anything—except
fat.</p>

<p class='c013'>A dramatist isn’t a dramatist at all until he has had
a play produced, no matter how many plays he may
have written, and he must get that first production at
any cost. It is natural enough that the managers
should hesitate before purchasing the play of an untried
writer, especially as there are only a few of them
who themselves know enough about a play to have any
real confidence in their own reaction. The successful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>author, of course, has a great advantage, and a man
with one or two hits to his credit can get a pretty bad
play accepted. Yet Mr. Shaw’s observation that “If
it’s by a good writer it’s a good play” doesn’t mean
quite as much as it used to, since the critic of late has
developed a rather alarming habit of eagerly leaping
at the throat of the man who is obviously trading on
an established reputation and trying to get away with
careless and sloppy work.</p>

<p class='c013'>In some ways it is, I think, more difficult for a beginner
to-day than it was in my youth. In those days
almost any play that got itself produced made some
money for its author and any honest writer of long
experience would own up to considerable sums made
from plays that cost their producers a lot of money.
To-day, however, plays die quickly and a failure
means that the writer gets little, if anything, more than
the trifling sum of his advance, which is seldom over
five hundred and almost never, in America, over one
thousand dollars. The pleasant old custom of a manager
keeping a young writer’s bad plays running long
enough for the writer to live comfortably until he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>learned how to write a better one has passed along
with the other nice old romantic notions and to-day
he has to hit it the first time or walk the plank.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>It is, naturally enough, about as difficult for the beginner
to learn how to write without any real chance
of slowly and gradually learning his business as it is
for the young actor of to-day to learn how to act without
any real experience in acting; he lacks the training
of the good stock companies of twenty years ago, or
of the classic drama where he had to play many small
parts before he was ever trusted with a big one. He
is asked now to play any part he can look, and is given
leading parts to play and fails in them more from lack
of experience than from lack of talent. This doesn’t
in the least mean that I think the acting of twenty-five
years ago was better than the acting of to-day, because
I know better. The lack of the training of the old
days is unfortunate, but the change in method more
than makes up for it, and although at present we have
few great actors we have a tremendous supply of very
competent ones. Although at this writing too many
of them are in Hollywood, we can still find a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>cast far more easily than we can find a good play,
and there are still far too many promising young
actors unable to get a chance to prove their worth.
But their problem is simple compared to the problem
of the young playwright, now or twenty years
ago.</p>

<p>HARRIGAN AND HART<br />(<i>From the Messmore Kendall Collection</i>)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Each generation, I suppose, has its own problems,
but the problem of the one starting out to win a place
in a crowded and difficult profession is never easily
solved. It is well, however, to remember that all
these fences built up in front of us to hold us back
remain firmly standing after we have managed to
scramble over them and they keep on blocking the
road and give a little breathing time to those who have
succeeded in getting a start.</p>

<p class='c013'>It’s a tough game any way you figure it, and it’s a
queer, lonely and depressing existence. A young
writer must do it all himself and usually against the
advice and the doubts of his acquaintances. He must
run around New York with that first play under his
arm until both his feet and his heart are sore, and he
rarely meets any one who takes the slightest interest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>in it. Nobody has any faith or confidence in him;
probably he has very little money—I very distinctly
remember that I had none at all—he will very likely
be as hungry and lonely and frightened as I was. But
if the play under that young writer’s arm is a real play—and
every once in a while it is—he is not a half
starved lonely vagrant but a prince on a masquerade.
He doesn’t know it; the cold and half contemptuous
clerks and secretaries he meets can’t see through his
disguise, but he is a bigger man than any of these
who snub him and outranks the best of them. Soon
his time will come—“The King is dead. Long live
the King.” At the time I started, however, I knew
nothing at all of what was ahead of me, and had, as
I recall it, few doubts and no misgivings.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fate having thrust me back into the ranks of the
dramatists I have never again dared to desert and devoted
my efforts only to play writing, although at odd
times, driven by financial or business necessity, I have
served in all the branches of the theater, having
worked as actor, stage manager, stage director, treasurer,
box-office man, advance agent, play doctor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>dramatist, business manager, partner in plays of
my own and of other writers, as well as in later years
serving a rather varied apprenticeship in the motion
picture studios both in New York and in California.</p>

<p class='c013'>Determined to sell this first play of mine I approached
at this time the firm of Davis and Keough
and tried to sell them a romantic costume drama dealing
with the Wars of the Roses. When Mr. Keough
got through laughing, he asked me to go that night
to see a play he had just produced called <span class='fss'>THE GREAT
TRAIN ROBBERY</span> and to call on him the next day.
When I called he asked me if “I thought I could write
a play like that.” I replied that I thought anybody
could, but didn’t see why they should. But when he
told me that he would give me five hundred dollars
if I wrote one he liked, I rushed back to my furnished
room and went to work. I am sure the play I wrote
was almost as bad as the one he sent me to see, but
for some deep managerial reason he couldn’t see it and
told me to go away and stop bothering him. The
Davis and Keough melodrama, however, had made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>me think. I had seen that the theater had been
crowded with an audience that responded tremendously
to the crude plot and the rather obvious situations
and, as I had told Mr. Keough, it had seemed
to me to be a simple formula to acquire. Later investigation
convinced me that this formula was capable
of some expansion without loss to its effectiveness and
I began a rather more scientific study of this form of
play manufacture than had ever before seemed necessary
to any of the writers who had been engaged in
it.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a result of this study I soon evolved a rather
mechanical but really effective mold that served me
in the writing of more than one hundred and fifty of
these melodramas with an average of success that
seems startling to me as I look back upon it. Charles
Dickens had beaten me to the trick and of course
many others have used it, but as a labor-saving device
it served me well. It had always seemed to me that
Dickens’s stories fell very readily into three molds: one
represented by <span class='fss'>THE TALE OF TWO CITIES</span>, one by <span class='fss'>DAVID
COPPERFIELD</span> and one by the strictly humorous type
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>represented by <span class='fss'>THE PICKWICK PAPERS</span>. I therefore devised
my molds, in my case represented by such western
thrillers as <span class='fss'>THE GAMBLER OF THE WEST</span>, the second
type the New York comedy-drama represented by
<span class='fss'>CHINATOWN CHARLIE</span> and <span class='fss'>BROADWAY AFTER DARK</span>, and
the last group of what Hollywood would call the
“sexy” type, illustrated by <span class='fss'>NELLIE, THE BEAUTIFUL
CLOAK MODEL</span> and a long string of her persecuted and
unfortunate sisters.</p>

<p class='c013'>It took me some months to figure all this out and
to experiment with my different forms, months of
very hard work, as I wrote all day and every night
went to the fifteen-cent gallery of one of the popular-priced
houses, making a real study, not of the plays
but of the audiences. When the very hard-boiled
gentleman who sat next to me wept or laughed or
applauded, I wasn’t at first always sure of his reason,
my duller mind not at that time responding to the
sentimental dramatic or comedy cue as quickly as his
trained intelligence, and I made a point of falling into
conversation with my neighbors in an effort to share as
fully in the delight of those present as was possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>for an unfortunate inhibited by a Harvard background.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a time, trained by my comrades in the packed
and poorly ventilated galleries, I found myself thrilling
with delight to the noble if somewhat banal sentiment
of such good old phrases as: “Rags are royal
raiment when worn for virtue’s sake,” and taking the
utmost satisfaction in the retribution that always followed
the villain and in the sweet, and somewhat
sticky, rewards of those whose feet had never strayed
from the straight and narrow path. Of course life was
never like that, but just as obviously it ought to be,
and to the dull lives of the working people of thirty-five
years ago these absurd dramas of ours brought
almost their only glimpse of romance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The old melodramas were practically motion pictures,
as one of the first tricks I learned was that my
plays must be written for an audience who, owing to
the huge, uncarpeted, noisy theaters, couldn’t always
hear the words and who, a large percentage of them
having only recently landed in America, couldn’t have
understood them in any case. I therefore wrote for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the eye rather than the ear and played out each
emotion in action, depending on my dialogue only
for the noble sentiments so dear to audiences of that
class.</p>

<p class='c013'>With my mind made up to a conquest of the sensational
melodrama field I worked hard on my first
script and in the course of time had it ready. Curiously
enough I had turned out a good play, rather
above the usual specimen of its kind, and as a matter
of fact one of the most honest and complete successes
I have ever had. I knew little of its worth at the time,
but I liked the thing, not unusual in a young dramatist,
and I made up my mind to have it produced. To that
end I made up a list of theatrical managers starting
with the A’s and ending with the X’s and set out to
call on all of them.</p>

<p class='c013'>I don’t remember much about the A’s but the B’s
were led by the name of William A. Brady. For a
week I called at his office daily with my play under
my arm. There seemed to be a certain vagueness
among Mr. Brady’s clerks as to when he could be seen
and after five or six days I ventured to ask one of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>where Mr. Brady was, to be met with the heart-felt
answer: “I wish to God I knew.” Which goes to
prove after all how slight are the changes the years
bring.</p>

<p class='c013'>Pursuing my alphabetical course, I came at last to the
H’s and found the name of “Gus Hill.” After diligent
inquiry I discovered that Gus Hill was the manager
of “Gus Hill’s Stars,” at that time holding forth in a
burlesque theater in Brooklyn. The day before the
D’s having failed me in the person of the late Augustin
Daly, I started for Brooklyn and Gus Hill. I asked for
Mr. Hill at the stage door of the Star Theatre and was
pointed out his dressing room and told that Mr. Hill
was “in there.” I knocked somewhat timidly at this
door and a voice called “Come in,” and I entered to see
a slight, blond, pleasant-looking man, quite naked,
who was rubbing himself down with a towel. I later
learned that Mr. Gus Hill was at that time the “Champion
Club Swinger of the World” and that he had
just finished his usual stunt of swinging great clubs
several times larger than himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>This was my introduction to Gus Hill and a true
account of how my first play was placed for production.
The play was a melodrama called <span class='fss'>THROUGH</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span><span class='fss'>THE BREAKERS</span> and it ran for five years in the popular-priced
theaters of America and was produced in England,
Australia and South Africa with real success.
In spite of Mr. Hill’s quite natural doubts, I did all
of the things I told him I would do, and by some kind
of luck or fate, or by the aid of a really tremendous
enthusiasm that has always been my one claim to anything
unusual in the way of talent, I got the play on
the stage and gave a really good performance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first matinée of <span class='fss'>THROUGH THE BREAKERS</span> was
the occasion of the second dramatic criticism to which
I alluded some half mile back in this rambling narrative.
The play was produced in Bridgeport, Conn.,
and the morning papers had been very flattering in
their account of the first performance of this first born
child of mine. I was standing at the back of the theater
during the matinée listening with rapture to my
words, and in all the world there is no listening to
equal a young author’s, when my bliss was rudely
shattered by a low-voiced comment from a gentleman
with a dirty collar who sat in the last row. “I have,”
remarked this gentleman to his companion, “seen a lot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>of shows in my time, but this is probably the rottenest
—— —— —— —— —— of a show I have ever seen!”</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in those days I was a meek and quiet and extremely
reasonable man so I merely smiled and bent
over the railing and touched the gentleman with the
dirty collar on the shoulder and whispered softly:
“Excuse me, but there is a message for you outside.”
After some persuasion I convinced the gentleman that
“some one outside” was asking for him and he followed
me willingly enough to the front door. The
theater, luckily, was what used to be called an “upstairs
house” and twenty-five or thirty steps led gently
down to the street. As we approached the head of
this stairway, still smiling I drew back my arm and
hit the astonished critic a snappy uppercut that tumbled
him all the way to the sidewalk, then returned to
my pleasant duty of listening to my own words.</p>

<p class='c013'>This story was noised abroad during the next fifteen
or twenty years and was once used by Alexander
Woollcott in an article; used, as I recall it, by him to
explain some favorable notice he had written of one
of my plays.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>In justice to myself, however, I must pause here to
say that I have been called worse things than the man
with the dirty collar called me by many critics who are
still alive and healthy. As a matter of fact I honestly
think that critics in the end are rarely unfair, and very
seldom wrong. It is an absurdity to say that they ever
make or break a play. A good play is a very sturdy
and very important force in itself, of far more importance
than the opinion of any critic, and in the end
it lives or dies because it’s good or because it isn’t.
Critics can, and have, made a bad play live for a short
time, but they never killed a good one—and what’s
more, they never wanted to. I have never been an
especial pet of dramatic critics, my somewhat spectacular
career not exactly fitting with their idea of the
proper dignity of a dramatist. Yet whenever I have
written a really fine play they have been quick and
generous in their praise of it. So I have always felt
they had a perfect right to go after me tooth and nail
upon the more frequent occasions when I have stubbed
my toe.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>────────────────<br />CHAPTER III <span class='small'>◆</span> THEN AND NOW<br />────────────────</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Dramatic criticism, like all of the other arts having
to do with our theater, has changed, and like the
others the change of the last few years has been for the
better. When I first came to New York, William
Winter was by far the outstanding critic, and his opinions
were eagerly waited for and had great influence.
I doubt if any critic of to-day is his equal in some ways,
yet the best men of to-day have, I think, a far greater
influence upon the actual writing of plays. In William
Winter’s time the Shakespearian tradition was
strong and the plays of modern writers were of secondary
importance. Acting then was more important
than play writing, while to-day the dramatist is the important
figure in almost every production.</p>

<p class='c013'>I do not in the least mean that acting to-day is any
less vital than it used to be, but the standard of acting
and of directing is very much higher. Very few first
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>class producers who are fortunate enough to secure
a good play are bunglers enough not to take full advantage
of it and we have grown to expect adequate
performances and take them quite as a matter of
course. Even ten years ago there were a number of
stars who were sure of some business no matter what
play they might appear in, but I think it is a fair statement
that to-day no actor alive can do any business
at all unless the play is satisfactory. In any case it was
the dramatist and not the actor who was responsible
for the birth of the new type of drama in America, and
when the writer threw into the discard the romantic,
the heroic and the sentimental, the actor was forced to
change his method. Booth and Jefferson could have
played in a modern reticent play, because they were,
in their day, outstanding in the quiet and normal
method they used, but most of the great actors of our
theater would have been lost if they had been deprived
of their grand passions and their carefully developed
heroics. Of course these men and women played in
the accepted tradition of their time, and their talents
would have been trained to-day in a different direction.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>We miss the diction of the good actor of the old school
and his beautifully trained voice, and his thorough
grasp of all the details of his business, but the characterizations
of to-day are far nearer to real life and
far less set and conventional than they were under the
old system. When I first went into the theater, an
actor would be handed a part and told that it was, let
us say, “a Sir Francis Levinson.” He would play it
that way, and usually play it very well, but frequently
in a rather tryingly cut and dried manner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Directing, too, has become very much more important
than it used to be, at least in the sense that
there are more good directors, although among the
list of men whom I consider to have been the best
directors I have ever known, several were of the theater
of years ago. Augustin Daly was a master; no
man of to-day is any better; for years his company
was quite justly the pride of America. A. M. Palmer
was a man of taste and shrewd knowledge of the
theater. He was the first man I ever worked with
and one of the best. Palmer was a man of great cultivation
and in his appearance amazingly different from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>any of our managers to-day. He was a very dignified
little man who wore a brand of whiskers now quite
obsolete, and his manner always seemed to me to be
more suited to the pulpit than to the stage. He was, I
am sure, both a worthy and a deeply religious man,
and it was his custom at the end of the last rehearsal
to stand on the stage, surrounded by his company, and
raise his hands in an attitude of benediction and say:
“Ladies and gentlemen—now we are in the hands of
God.” I recall an occasion when he rather spoiled the
effect of this pious observation by turning to the stage
electrician and continuing in the same breath: “And
for God’s sake don’t you forget that first act light cue
again.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Charles Hoyt, probably the best farce writer the
world has ever known, was a fine director. All of his
plays were built at rehearsal and on the road before
their first New York engagement. It was his custom
to engage a cast of sure-fire comedians and fashion his
play around them. He would call on Tim Murphy,
Otis Harlan, May Irwin and actors of that standing,
and start out with his central idea, always an ironic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>snapshot of some social or political absurdity. When
his play first opened, it would run at the most about
thirty minutes, and each of the performers would be
called upon to sing two or three songs or do their
specialty. Out they would go, usually into New England,
in the early spring, and as the days passed there
would be more and more dialogue and fewer and
fewer songs, until in the end the farce would have been
written and ready for its New York opening. Hoyt
built in this way <span class='fss'>A TEXAS STEER</span>, <span class='fss'>A TRIP TO CHINATOWN</span>,
<span class='fss'>A RAG BABY</span>, <span class='fss'>A TIN SOLDIER</span> and several
others, all of them sound farces and all of them very
successful.</p>

<p class='c013'>David Belasco then, as now, was a master of the
mechanics of the theater, and is a man who always has
amazed me and won my very honest admiration. His
love of the theater as an institution is, I am sure, as
deep and as real as mine, and his skill and patience
and perfection of detail had a great influence upon the
growth of our theater.</p>

<p class='c013'>Henry Miller was not only a great director, but I
think the greatest teacher of acting I have ever known.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>Any young actor or actress who passed through his
hands had something behind them. He died as he
had lived, ready for his job—waiting for the curtain
to go up—and although I have never wanted to exchange
my own life for any other man’s, I must admit
I am a little envious of Henry Miller’s death.</p>

<p class='c013'>Charles Frohman knew what he wanted of his company
and how to get it, and Daniel Frohman’s company
was always guided by his good taste and honesty.
Daniel Frohman is no longer active as a producer,
but he holds, I think, the first place in the hearts of all
of us who work in the theater. In saying this I am
not thinking alone of his work for the Actors’ Fund,
although his work there has been enormously important.
But aside from that his sympathy and his
appreciation of all the good work done by any of us,
actor or dramatist, have given courage and joy to a lot
of hard workers who at times were in sore need of
both. I know that among my treasures I have a letter
he wrote me just after the production of <span class='fss'>ICEBOUND</span>
that I value above the Pulitzer Prize that soon followed
it. We of the theater are a close corporation, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>value the praise of our own people more than we do
any opinion from the outside.</p>

<p class='c013'>Erlanger, the business head of the theater for many
years, had a lot to do with the production of his own
plays, and although not a director, he made his influence
felt.</p>

<p class='c013'>William A. Brady at his best is a truly inspired
director, and I have seen him do work that was fine
and true; his ear is almost perfect, and his sense
of the pulse and rhythm of melodrama is absolutely
unfailing. He has faults to offset these virtues, but
when he is right, when the scene he is directing is
the kind of scene he knows about, he is a hard man
to beat.</p>

<p class='c013'>I could go on writing for hours of the many adventures
I had with Mr. Brady, grave and gay, absurd
and thrilling, but in all of them there was at least the
virtue of novelty. In all the years I worked with him
he never by any chance did what I expected him to do,
and he never did the same thing twice. After I was
through with the popular-priced drama and was making
an effort to get started as a Broadway writer, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>was the first man who had any confidence in me, and
he gave me my first chance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Picking in my mind at random for a story in which
Mr. Brady figures, I am suddenly swamped by the
recollection of a hundred. I recall, for instance, how
he and John Cranwell and I worked for five days and
six nights at a dress rehearsal of <span class='fss'>THE WORLD WE LIVE IN</span>
without a break, living on ham sandwiches and milk
and sleeping for half an hour at a time on a pile of
discarded drapery. Our first important play together
was <span class='fss'>THE FAMILY CUPBOARD</span>. The big scene was a conflict
between a son and his father, in which the boy
strikes the father, then, overcome by horror and remorse,
falls sobbing at the father’s feet. Forrest
Wynant was the boy and William Morris the father.
Neither Mr. Brady nor I was satisfied with the progress
of the scene, and at length Mr. Brady jumped up
on the stage and brushed Mr. Wynant aside and
played the long and very dramatic scene for him, and
ended by falling sobbing at William Morris’s feet,
absolutely all in from the terrific effort he had made.
As he ended there was a silence—we were all thrilled—Brady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>lay there panting and perspiring. Mr. Wynant
alone seemed to be unmoved. He looked down
at Mr. Brady’s heaving figure and said earnestly—“Mr.
Brady—would you mind doing that again?”</p>

<p class='c013'>Some years later, at the dress rehearsal of a mystery
play of mine, <span class='fss'>AT 9.45</span>, John Cranwell and I were alone
in the front of the theater. Mr. Brady was ill at home.
The rehearsal was dreadful; there was no pace at all;
it was dead and flat, and I knew that unless some
miracle happened we faced a failure. We had been
told not to bother Mr. Brady, but I was desperate, and
without a word to John Cranwell I ran out of the theater
and drove to Mr. Brady’s house, where I dragged
him out, almost by force, sick and surly. He arrived at
the theater protesting that he was a dying man and
couldn’t possibly be of any help to me even if he
wanted to, and that he was remarkably sure he didn’t,
or words to that effect. Still grumbling, he stepped
through the front door and as he did so his ear caught
the flat note in the performance that had so alarmed
me. In ten seconds he was at the footlights with the
entire company following his tone as an orchestra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>follows the hand of their conductor, and in two hours
he had set the tempo of the play.</p>

<p class='c013'>This same <span class='fss'>AT</span> 9.45 was the only play not closed by
the actors’ strike of eleven years ago; we kept it open—I
am sure I don’t know why—and I doubt if Mr.
Brady does. It was, I suppose, because we both of us
love a fight and we had a perfectly grand time in doing
a thing that no one else was able to do. As most of our
actors left us at the first demand of their union, we
would have been sunk at once if Mr. Brady had not
called for help, and we built up a cast from some very
important actors who were not in sympathy with the
Equity Society. There were, however, very few of
these, and it became necessary for Mr. Brady himself
to play the most difficult part, a butler with a big scene.
He played him—big scene and all—plus the most
amazing stage side-whiskers I had seen in many years.
Mr. Brady loved it, whiskers and all, and had the time
of his life. I truly think he was sorry when the strike
was ended.</p>

<p class='c013'>Winthrop Ames was one of the fine stage directors,
and although never especially active in the theater,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>every production he made was almost perfect in its
detail.</p>

<p class='c013'>Winchell Smith, the best of the dramatist-directors,
knows more theater than any of us, and has been responsible
for a lot of fine work.</p>

<p class='c013'>James Forbes, Rachel Crothers, George Kelly,
Elmer Rice and Frank Craven are all first rate directors
of their own plays. I myself have had a lot of
experience in this work but I am sorry to say that I
have one rather annoying trait as a director. It is so
much easier for me to make up a new play than it is
to be bothered by following a manuscript that I am
quite likely to get my company a trifle mixed.</p>

<p class='c013'>Among the professional directors, Robert Milton
is a first class man and Sam Forrest has skill and great
experience. Hugh Ford, who worked with George
Tyler for many years, had probably the longest unbroken
string of successes.</p>

<p class='c013'>George Abbott, both as a writer, actor and director,
brings sanity and good judgment to every job he
undertakes and deserves every bit of his very unusual
success.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Aside from the dramatists who direct their own
plays and the free lance stage directors, there is, of
course, Arthur Hopkins, in many ways a better man
than any of us. He does a play because he likes it;
it doesn’t in the least matter to him whether you or I
like it or not; he is absolutely untouched by any man’s
opinion but his own, and surely no one man in our
theater has done so much fine work or done it with
a higher motive. He saw beauty in it—no other
reason ever did or ever will make him produce a
play.</p>

<p class='c013'>George Tyler, John Golden and Sam Harris are
managers who are constructive in their attitude to
authors and many of their successes have been due to
their sympathetic attitude toward the authors with
whom they work.</p>

<p class='c013'>George Cohan is a great director and a remarkable
play-doctor, but of late his own plays have taken most
of his time.</p>

<p class='c013'>Jed Harris seems to me to be a truly remarkable
editor. I have never seen him direct a play, but I have
talked plays with him, and if I am any judge of plays
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>he knows a lot about them. He has gone far already
for so young a man, but he will go further.</p>

<p class='c013'>Reuben Marmoulain and Chester Erskine are
among the new men. Both of them have something.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are other good directors, of course. Just at
present I have been writing only of the men I knew.</p>

<p class='c013'>The theater of the nineties, even the first class theater,
was very different from what it is to-day and the
difference, of course, was due to the difference in our
audiences. The stage always reflects the times and
one could easily enough get a mental picture of any
period or of any civilization by a careful study of ten
or a dozen successful dramas and comedies of the day.</p>

<p class='c013'>America during these years was still dominated by
a Puritan tradition and its drama was based upon a
stern Puritan creed and an almost equally uncomfortable
sentimentality. It must be remembered also that
at this time our “melting pot” joke was at its very
funniest and every year hundreds of thousands of foreign
born flung themselves upon our hospitable, if
somewhat undiscriminating, shores and each year a
good number of these were joined to our audiences.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>The demand was for good acting also rather than for
good plays, just as it is now in the “talkies.” It is, I
think, only when the drama has grown to maturity
that the focus shifts from the player to the play.</p>

<p class='c013'>Bronson Howard was the favorite playwright of
New York when I arrived there, although the growing
success of young Augustus Thomas threatened his
supremacy. Edward Harrigan was very popular, both
as an actor and a writer, and deservedly so. The spirit
of America has always seemed to me to have been best
reflected by three men, who followed one another and
kept alive a true spirit of the folk play, writing of
men and women, of happenings and emotions of the
everyday life around them: William Harrigan, Charles
Hoyt and George Cohan. These three have left very
deep footprints and in the case of George Cohan at
least much more than that. The peculiar comedy
style of all of our American playwrights of to-day was
directly founded on his droll staccato and even the
very modern wise-crack has descended from his careless
impudence.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>To me it has always been of great interest to watch
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>how the type of writer, and the type of play changed
and progressed with the change in the character and
the standards of our audiences. Only the superficial
observer will claim superiority in the plays of 1890 to
the plays of 1910, and since 1910 we have had an
almost steady growth in the art of the serious dramatist,
a growth so important that beside it the smudges
of filth spilled by a few unimportant scribblers may
very easily be forgotten. The question of dirt in the
theater in any case is no longer of any real importance.
The extreme frankness of modern society, the freedom
with which all sorts of questions are discussed
in the home and in all walks of life, has acted as a
complete disinfectant. It was an extremely easy thing
to shock small coins out of a Puritan community but
the man who has skill enough to successfully pander
to an over-sophisticated audience usually has sense
enough to use that skill to better advantage. The
censor in the end will disappear, not wholly because
he is no longer needed but because he will be no longer
understood.</p>

<p class='c013'>My grandfather and his family walked to church
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>every Sunday because to drive on the Lord’s Day was
a sin. I walk four miles around a golf course every
Sunday, and it is probable that my moral standards
are as high as his were.</p>

<p class='c013'>If I am sure of anything at all, I am sure that I am
not my brother’s keeper, and, deeply as I resent dirt
for dirt’s sake in the theater, I know that the way to
end it is not by allowing some one person or some
group of persons to set up their own moral or ethical
standard and compel the rest of the world to abide
by it. The professional moralist soon standardizes his
own beliefs just as the professional politician does, and
he never has and never can properly represent the shifting
taste of the majority. Just what may properly be
discussed on the stage or in society varies so greatly
with the passing moods of the times that any fixed
and rigid rules soon become fixed and rigid absurdities.
I distinctly recall the extraordinary difficulty
my mother had some forty odd years ago in delicately
conveying to us the news that our old dog was soon
to have an increase in her family, and in those days
a female dog was called a female dog, economized
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>speech being at that time considered to be of less importance
than elegance.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have studied plays all my life and I am sure I don’t
know enough about them to be qualified to act as a
censor. I am equally sure that it would be very difficult
to find any man who knows more about them
than I do who would consent to act in that capacity.
The temper of our people is further away to-day than
it ever was before from all these laws that try to compel
us all to live according to the beliefs of a handful
of persons who still cling frantically to the old Puritan
notion that all one has to do to abolish sin is to
forbid it. The thing that should be unlawful in the
theater is bad taste, and good taste is the result of education,
not of restriction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every tendency of our American drama to-day is
toward drawing a more cultivated and more sophisticated
audience. The demand of this audience is for
plays that mean something, and as soon as all the
dramatists and all the managers who still seem to be
blind to this fact are snugly relegated to the poor house
we shall have no more talk of censorship. I have never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>in my life seen a dirty play that has had one-tenth as
much effect upon an audience as many a fine play I
could name has had, partly because the mass reaction
of every audience is always healthy, and partly because
fine plays are written by fine dramatists, and dirty
plays are written by incompetent scribblers. The instinctive
feeling that it is a fine thing to be a gentleman
that comes from sitting through one performance
of <span class='fss'>JOURNEY’S END</span> will go much deeper under
any normal skin than any dirty joke heard in an off-color
musical show. If I for one moment thought
that the theater had anything at all to do with forming
the moral tone of a nation, I might have more
patience with all this talk of political and national
censorship, but I know better. The theater reflects
that tone, it does not guide it.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have the masculine man’s contempt for dirty plays,
arising, I suppose, from the fact that masculine men
never write them. Dirty plays are always written
either by women or by effeminate men, and always
have been. There is, of course, a pathological reason
for this, but the fact remains that the normal and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>healthy male is not especially interested in the eavesdropping
of the servants’ hall, and, although he may
offend by bluntness and lack of taste, he is seldom
downright nasty.</p>

<p class='c013'>I hope that no one who reads these rather rambling
notes of mine will think that I have any desire to deny
the woman playwright any particle of credit, but I
use the word playwright as I use the word actor, to
describe any one who devotes themselves to these arts,
either man or woman. Sex seems rather unimportant
to me beside the fact that one can act or write. Of
course some of our fine plays have been written by
women, and many of the greatest actors the world has
ever known have been of the feminine sex. It would
be difficult to name three men who ranked as actors
beside Bernhardt, Duse and Charlotte Cushman, and
in the theater of to-day I dare any one to make a list
of five men who could stand comparison with Mrs.
Fiske, Jane Cowl, Pauline Lord, Helen Hayes and
Ethel Barrymore.</p>

<p class='c013'>Through the nineties Charles Frohman produced a
long line of well-made English dramas, and the Pinero
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>school of expert craftsmen took the place of the writers
of polite melodrama. Charles Kline brought his skill
in bringing forward controversial subjects of timely
interest and Clyde Fitch arrived with his box of parlor
tricks. Edward Sheldon came down from Harvard
with about the first authentic message and in him I
have always felt the spark of the true dramatist. Eugene
Walter in <span class='fss'>THE EASIEST WAY</span> produced the first
important American play unless some of the less
widely known of the James A. Hearn plays deserve
that rating. Personally I thought <span class='fss'>MARGUERITE FLEMING</span>
a very fine thing. But <span class='fss'>THE EASIEST WAY</span> was a
little after the time I have been writing of and my
problem at that moment was to learn a simpler trade.</p>

<p class='c013'>As it happens, I have lived my personal life rather
away from my fellow workers of the theater, not because
I haven’t always valued the friendship of actors
but because I have been a miser of my time. I have
never been much of a club man and nothing at all
of a social butterfly. I am sure that the sight of me,
pushed into evening clothes by a stern wife and perspiring
copiously in an effort to conceal my rage and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>rebellion, is enough to cast a pall over any social gathering.
Even in Hollywood, where dinner guests may
be more readily hired than anywhere else on earth,
I, if I should lose my credit at my hotel, would undoubtedly
starve to death. I have never even been
a member of the Lambs Club and, for no other reason
than that by not allowing myself to get into the
habit of having anything to do but my work, I have
naturally gained a good many hours.</p>

<p class='c013'>During my time as a dramatist, during which I have
written between two and three hundred plays, I have
had, if we figure twelve characters to a play, somewhere
around three thousand actors to play these parts.
Naturally I have known all these men and women
well and, as I have seen practically every drama, farce
and comedy of any importance at all that has been
produced during all these thirty-five years, I may claim
fairly enough an acquaintance with our American
players.</p>

<p class='c013'>To me there have been a lot of good actors in the
world and one mighty one—unfortunately not an
American and more unfortunately already an old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>woman when I first saw her—but Sarah Bernhardt
had the power to do something to me that no one else
could ever do. I had no critical judgment of her at
all. She spoke, and I listened and believed. Edwin
Booth still seems to me to be the greatest of the others,
although a long way behind the “Divine Sarah.” I
saw Booth first as Hamlet during my second year at
Harvard in the winter of 1890. I saw him later with
Modjeska and Otis Skinner in several plays and with
Lawrence Barrett the following year in <span class='fss'>OTHELLO</span>. He
was as simple and as true in his acting as any of our
fine actors of to-day, although the method of his time
was declamatory and artificial. I dimly recall the
elder Salvini in some version of Dr. Bird’s <span class='fss'>THE GLADIATOR</span>,
but I was too young at the time to carry away
any more definite impression than that he had the
loudest voice I had ever heard. Jefferson had great
skill and a wonderful personality and his “Rip,” the
model for the Lightnin’ Bills, the Old Soaks and all
of their lovable disreputable brotherhood, remains
towering above them all.</p>

<p class='c013'>Richard Mansfield I thought very like the little girl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>who had a little curl—when he was bad he was awful.
In some of her parts, especially in <span class='fss'>THE TAMING OF THE
SHREW</span> and in a lightweight, imported comedy called
<span class='fss'>THE LOVE CHASE</span>, I have never seen Ada Rehan’s equal.
Janauschek had a real tragic power, and at her best
Modjeska was superb. Just how to place Maude
Adams I have never known, but I do know that she
has charmed and fascinated me so often that I think
it only fair to give her the credit of listing her with
the great.</p>

<p class='c013'>If no names in our theater to-day stand quite so
high as these, I think it is the writer’s fault rather than
the actors’, or possibly the fault of the audiences who
have turned away from the romantic play to the grim
and reticent drabness of the naturalistic drama. The
glamor and the sweep of the old declamatory school
naturally furnished the actor with a better chance to
score than he has to-day. Then, of course, the great
passions of the romances of thirty years ago find no
response in our audiences. Life is quite as amazing
as it ever was but by no means as mysterious. We
have dissected and psychoanalyzed ourselves and one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>another past the point where we stand in awe of any
one’s “darkened soul” and advise calomel. Then too
our audiences are different; even thirty years ago thousands
of our people thought the theater a place of evil
and were convinced that anything that represented
romance or the glamorous was sinful. The death of
this notion was a very healthy symptom and the start
toward a sane understanding of life.</p>

<p class='c013'>As any man of the world knows, the diversions
usually listed as sins gained their following very largely
from the free spirits who searched for forbidden things,
the prescribed pleasures being of rather dubious enchantment.
The fact that these stock sins are usually
shabby, ugly and dull was kept a profound secret. If
we could convince our young people that as a usual
thing it is more fun to be decent than it is to go poking
about in dark places we would make as great a
step forward in our morals as we have in our drama.
After all in both it’s simply a case of frankness and
honesty.</p>

<p class='c013'>These were the years of the complete control of
the theater by the famous syndicate, Klaw and Erlanger,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the Frohmans, Rich and Harris, Hayman,
Nixon and Zimmerman. No longer were we vagabonds
and strolling players. The out of town manager
who used to spend his summer standing on a
corner on Fourteenth Street, where his shabby silk
hat was his only office, now had his attractions booked
for him by the Klaw and Erlanger Agency. The syndicate,
successful from the first, soon secured control
of practically all of the first class houses in the country
and a once careless, slipshod business became regulated.
Thanks to the syndicate and to Lee Shubert,
who alone and unaided challenged this great organization
to battle and fought them so stiff a draw that
for years the spoils were divided between them, authors
now began to eat as regularly as ordinary mortals,
and the high-powered motor cars so common to
playwrights to-day can trace their being to this source.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no doubt at all that these two great forces
in the theater are responsible for making a business
of what had before their time been a sort of gypsy’s
occupation, but unfortunately the fates are rarely prodigal
and the men gifted with the ability to organize
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>an art have never yet known what to do with it after
it is organized. They always remind me of the cowboy
who fought the bear and after getting him down
had to call for help because he was afraid to let go.
As a matter of fact I have wondered of late if there
wasn’t such a thing as being too successful in organization.
I have given a lot of time to the welding together
of our Dramatists’ Guild, just as many other
playwrights have, and now we are extremely well organized,
with nobody to fight.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Actors’ Equity is all powerful after years of
honest effort, but more actors are out of work than
ever before. It’s a fine thing for the actor and the
writer to be able to enforce fair conditions of employment,
but unfortunately we can’t force the employment
itself. A good job under fair conditions is a
great thing, but no job at all isn’t so good. It may
be worth a thought in passing that if we of the two
creative groups in the theater had been as active in
working for the theater itself as we were in fighting
for the power of our individual groups, we might at
this writing be better off. Even yet we might, by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>sacrifice of some of the power we have gained, help
to bring back strength to the business that must flourish
if we are to flourish. We need have no fear of
the old tyrannies; they have gone forever. When
actors and authors meet their old antagonists, the managers,
to-day, they meet on equal ground and, as my
old comrade Gene Buck puts it: “All false whiskers
are off, and everybody comes out from behind the
bushes.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The complete control of the drama in America by
the business men of the theater started at about the
time I entered the lists and continued for about twenty
years. Under their rule prosperity came to us and
lasted up to the time when the public became tired of
a drama that soon became a factory product, as was
the natural result of a system that put the business
man in control of the creative artist. I have seen this
happen so many times, in so many forms of the amusement
business, that it has grown to be an old story
to me.</p>

<p class='c013'>I am old enough to remember the group of managers
who were the leading producers just before the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>time of the “syndicate” and I know the difference in
their methods and ideals. Daly, A. M. Palmer, Daniel
and Charles Frohman, and the great stars like Booth,
Jefferson, Modjeska, Fannie Davenport and a few
others had a real following both in New York and
on the road; each one of them represented something.
The public knew what to expect if they went to Daly’s
Theatre, or to Daniel Frohman’s Lyceum on Fourth
Avenue, just as they knew what to expect of Edwin
Booth or Joe Jefferson. If A. M. Palmer made a production
one knew very well the sort of entertainment
that would be offered. From Hoyt or from Harrigan
you knew the type of play that would be presented
and took it or left it as your taste decided.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the rise to power of the “syndicate” Charles
Frohman kept close to a definite standard, but Booth,
Jefferson, Hoyt, Palmer, Harrigan and Daly were
gone, and in their places rose up a new crop of managers,
men of my time, most of them friends of mine,
who were more or less timidly knocking at the door
at about the time I was trying to break in. Sam Harris,
when I first knew him, was Terry McGovern’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>manager; Al Woods was an advance agent ahead of
a sensational melodrama and known as the best man
in the show business to draw a big opening to a bad
play. Archie Selwyn was an office boy for a firm of
play-brokers. Edgar Selwyn was trying to get a start
as an actor and often reminds me of the fact that when
I was casting my first play he came to me for a job
and was met by a very cold reception. If Mr. Selwyn
is telling the truth about this, as he probably is, although
I can’t in the least recall the incident, it goes
to show that I still had a lot to learn, because he was
a very good actor, much better, I am sure, than any
one I chose above him.</p>

<p class='c013'>These young men came into the theater and took
important places in it and rode to fortune on the wave
of prosperity that was at its height during these years.
They were joined in time by a younger group, the
Theatre Guild, Arthur Hopkins, and later still Jed
Harris, all of whom had as definite a thing to say as
the old group of managers a full generation before
them. In saying it they started the change in popular
taste that meant the end of the commercial theater,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>and the birth of what before long will be a theater
of taste and intelligence. Men like George Tyler, Dillingham,
Winthrop Ames, Ziegfeld and William A.
Brady had gone on producing their particular type of
play and keeping a little apart from the rest. Way
back, however, in 1898, all managers were mighty
men in my eyes, and the least of them was sacred.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>────────────────<br />CHAPTER IV <span class='small'>◆</span> “HOLD, VILLAIN”<br />────────────────</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Gus Hill and I, started so prosperously with
<span class='fss'>THROUGH THE BREAKERS</span>, kept up a very pleasant
association for several seasons, and whenever I
meet him now after the passing of more than twenty-five
years I am conscious of a feeling of good will and
something that is almost affection. I wrote several
plays for him and one of them, <span class='fss'>LOST IN THE DESERT</span>,
brought about my meeting with Elizabeth Breyer, a
young actress who had been playing with E. H. Sothern.
I with some difficulty persuaded her to become a
member of the <span class='fss'>LOST IN THE DESERT</span> company, and a few
months later and with much more difficulty persuaded
her to become a member of the Davis family. The last
engagement has lasted some twenty-five years longer
than the first and has been much more successful.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='fss'>LOST IN THE DESERT</span> was to have been a challenge
thrown by Mr. Hill and me straight in the face of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Augustin Daly, Belasco and Charles Frohman. We
had made a lot of money with <span class='fss'>THROUGH THE BREAKERS</span>
and one or two other plays and saw no reason why
we shouldn’t spend it. We built a wonderful production,
hired a band of Arab acrobats, trained four
horses, engaged a fine cast and worked very hard, but
although the play wasn’t a failure it never made any
money and in the end we lost our investment.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the season in which Mr. Hill and I produced
<span class='fss'>LOST IN THE DESERT</span> which was, I think, my
third year as a writer of sensational melodramas, I
had played Syracuse and met Sam, Lee, and Jake Shubert,
who had not at that time invaded New York but
were in control of theaters in Syracuse, Rochester and
Utica. They were boys at that time. I was twenty-six
and Lee, the oldest of the Shuberts, was at least two
years younger. Sam was a man of picturesque and
colorful personality and had a real taste for the theater
but I always thought the great success of these
young men was due to Lee. He himself gave all the
glory to his younger brother whose tragic death, however,
forced him to come out as the head of the firm.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>Lee Shubert is a strong and absolutely fearless man,
not a lover of the theater as David Belasco is but a
business man who plays with theaters and plays, with
authors and actors as pawns in a game of high finance.
His influence in the theater has been very great and
no one who knows the story of his fight against Klaw
and Erlanger and their powerful associates can fairly
withhold real admiration for his courage and energy.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the week my play was at the Bastable Theatre
in Syracuse, Lee Shubert persuaded me to sign a
contract taking over the Baker Theatre, Rochester,
for a season of summer stock. I eagerly fell for his
idea as I was hungry for the experience and knew that
it would be of great benefit to me. I have always been
curious to see the inside workings of every branch of
the theatrical business and in the years since then I
doubt if there is any ramification of the game in which
I have not had a finger, sometimes a burned finger,
but always an eager one.</p>

<p class='c013'>I signed this contract and engaged a company in
New York before I started on a western tour with
<span class='fss'>LOST IN THE DESERT</span>. Unfortunately, however, before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>the date of the Rochester opening came round, my
share of the losses on <span class='fss'>LOST IN THE DESERT</span> had so eaten
up my profits on <span class='fss'>THROUGH THE BREAKERS</span> that I arrived
in Rochester with no assets beyond a perfectly
good wife and fifty-four dollars in cash to meet fifteen
trusting actors who were to depend upon me for their
living for the next twenty weeks.</p>

<p class='c013'>Details are apt to escape one’s mind after twenty-five
years, but I have some hazy recollection of having
been rather up against it there in Rochester. My
books, however, prove that I opened the season with
<span class='fss'>THE FATAL CALL</span>—loss five hundred and two dollars—and
followed with <span class='fss'>THE TWO ORPHANS</span>—loss three hundred
and six dollars. I can’t help wishing those books
of mine told me how I did it.</p>

<p class='c013'>One memory, however, is very clear. The play for
the third week arrived from the play brokers, C.O.D.,
two hundred dollars, and lay in the express office as
safe from me as it is ever possible for any play to be.
I was quite at the end of my string and had no possible
avenue of escape. That day, after the matinée
of <span class='fss'>THE TWO ORPHANS</span>, I said a polite good day to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>deputy sheriff who seemed to have taken a great fancy
to my private chair in the theater’s box office and started
walking the streets trying to think of some possible
means of keeping my company together. In my walk
I passed a second hand book store and my eye caught
the title of a ragged old volume in the tray marked
“ten cents”—<span class='fss'>UNDER TWO FLAGS</span>. This cross marks the
spot where I started a trick of high pressure play writing,
a trick which of course I put sternly behind me long
years ago, although I have never been able to convince
many people of my reformation. In any case Owen
Davis’ Baker Theatre Stock Company opened five days
later in a dramatization of <span class='fss'>UNDER TWO FLAGS</span> and
played for four weeks—profit $10,250 (by the book).</p>

<p class='c013'>For four years I ran this company in Rochester
every summer and during that time, in partnership
with the Shuberts, took over houses in Syracuse, Utica,
Brooklyn and Philadelphia. They were busy years.
In Rochester I was company manager, stage director,
press agent, head box-office boy and whenever business
got bad I’d write the next week’s play to save
paying for one.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>During all this time Mrs. Davis was a member of
the company and adored by the Rochester audiences.
She might have had a brilliant career in the theater
if she had chosen to stick to it instead of devoting her
life to “her men” as she has always called us, “her
men” being myself and our sons, Donald and Owen,
Jr. For a long time I am afraid she found it very hard
to give up the work she loved but I am sure she is
well rewarded for her sacrifice now in the excitement
and joy of seeing these two boys climbing so sturdily
ahead on the path she knows so well—an unusual
experience for a mother—not only to have hope and
faith in her sons but to know exactly what each step
they take means and where they are going.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the following five years we divided our
time between these stock companies in the summer
and New York in the winter. In those five years I
wrote thirty-eight melodramas, two farces, a number
of vaudeville acts and burlesque pieces and one big
show for the Hippodrome, as well as picking up any
other little job that came to hand.</p>

<p class='c013'>It was during this time I wrote my first play for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Sam Harris, then a member of the firm of Sullivan,
Harris and Woods, and started a friendship that has
lasted ever since. A little later Al Woods sent for me
and told me he was leaving the firm and was about
to set up for himself. Our interview ended in the
drawing of the most remarkable contract ever made
between a manager and an author. By its terms
Woods was to produce not less than four new plays,
and after the first year, four old ones each season for
five years. During that time I could not write for any
other manager and he could not produce a play written
by any other author. During the five years Mr.
Woods produced fifty odd plays of mine but we both
of us cheated shamefully on the other part of our
agreement. We produced a number of plays by the
late Theodore Kramer and I sneaked a few over with
other popular-priced managers of the day.</p>

<p class='c013'>Woods was, and is, a remarkable man, a great showman
and a man of humorous and philosophic nature.
His outstanding characteristic is, to me, that if he loves
a play he knows how to produce it. If he tries to do
a play he doesn’t love he knows nothing about it and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>cares less. He has but two opinions of a play when
he reads it, “Swell” or “It don’t appeal to me,” and
when he plays his hunch he’s very apt to succeed.
This instinctive feel for values is one of the greatest
assets in the equipment of the theatrical manager and
Al Woods and William A. Brady have more of it than
any other men of my time. It is a pure instinct, quite
apart from any critical faculty and is emotional rather
than the result of any reasoning.</p>

<p class='c013'>David Belasco, a great showman, always seemed
to me to see in a play manuscript the thing it would
develop into under his guidance, but Woods and
Brady sense an audience’s response to certain sorts of
melodramatic situations and when they play their instinct
and not their judgment they usually are right.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first play under my contract with Woods was
<span class='fss'>THE CONFESSIONS OF A WIFE</span>, which really wasn’t nearly
so dreadful as it sounds. The second was <span class='fss'>THE GAMBLER
OF THE WEST</span>, probably the best popular-priced
melodrama produced during these years. Then came
<span class='fss'>CONVICT 999</span>, <span class='fss'>CHINATOWN CHARLIE</span> and the famous
<span class='fss'>NELLIE, THE BEAUTIFUL CLOAK MODEL</span>.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>During my time with Al Woods, one of our most
unusual experiences was with a melodrama called <span class='fss'>THE
MARKED WOMAN</span> and only a day or two ago, when I
dropped into Mr. Woods’ office for a friendly chat,
Martin Herman, Mr. Woods’ brother and general
manager, gravely brought us in a contract, yellow with
age, to remind us of an absurd but to us at the time a
perfectly normal activity. In those days everything
was fish that came to our net. If a particularly horrible
murder excited the public, we had it dramatized
and on the stage usually before any one knew who
had been guilty of the crime. Frequently I have had
a job of hasty re-writing when it became evident that
my chosen culprit from real life was an innocent and
perfectly respectable citizen.</p>

<p class='c013'>I went into the Woods office one day about twenty-five
years ago and noticed a well-dressed and well-mannered
young Chinaman patiently seated in a chair
in the waiting room. I asked Martin Herman what
he wanted and Martin replied that he was crazy and
that Al couldn’t be bothered with him. Later in the
day, however, Oriental patience conquered and as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>result I was called into conference with Mr. Woods
and this well-mannered Chinaman.</p>

<p class='c013'>With some difficulty Woods and I were made to
understand that our friend from the Orient was the
custodian of a very large sum of real money which
he wanted to devote to the cause of the Liberal Party
in China. These were the days of the old Empress
and the Republican Party was just beginning to be
heard from. Part of their activity was to arouse in
America an antagonism toward the late Empress
Dowager and I was asked to write and Mr. Woods
to produce a play in which the poor old lady would
be shown up as a sort of composite picture of all the
evil characters of history. Woods and I had never
met any Empresses at the time—although at this writing
I understand Mr. Woods is in the habit of hobnobbing
with all the crowned heads of Europe—but
as there was no doubt at all of the money being both
real and plentiful we swallowed our scruples, if we
had any, and what I did to the old Empress of China
I shudder to recall.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I finished the play and took it to Woods,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>he said it was a whale, although I myself had some
doubts of its merit. Our Chinese angel, by now reënforced
by a committee of his fellow countrymen, said
it was without doubt a mighty drama and their only
suggestion was that they would like to see a scene put
in where the Empress poisoned a child. I sternly refused
to surrender the integrity of my script, although
I made some small concessions in the nature of arson
and murder and <span class='fss'>THE MARKED WOMAN</span> was ready for
production.</p>

<p class='c013'>The popular-priced circuit never had seen such a
lavish display—please remember that all bills were
paid by the Republican Party of China—costumes had
been sent us from Pekin, the duty alone on which was
many times more than any play had ever cost us. To
this day my wife has several gorgeous Chinese robes,
her only graft in all these years.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='fss'>THE MARKED WOMAN</span>, to my surprise, was a great
success from the first, although Edward E. Rose, who
staged it, and I were not quite satisfied with the last
act and determined to improve it. About three weeks
after the opening, Mr. Rose and I jumped out to Elizabeth,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>New Jersey, where the company was playing,
and watched a matinée performance. As soon as the
final curtain fell we rushed back stage and called the
company for rehearsal. I seated myself at a table with
a pad of paper and threw the sheets at Ed Rose as I
filled them while he forced the lines into the poor
actors’ heads and re-grouped and re-staged the scenes.
The result was that we played that night, only three
hours later, the last act for our second act and the second
act for our last. This was, I am confident, about
as complete a job of revision as was ever accomplished
between a matinée and a night.</p>

<p class='c013'>All went well with <span class='fss'>THE MARKED WOMAN</span> for some
time but one day our Chinese backers called on Mr.
Woods and told him that the play must close at once.
Mr. Woods, who had a hit on his hands, smiled pleasantly
and asked the reason and was told that the most
powerful of the Chinese Tongs had threatened to kill
our friends if the play was performed after one more
week. Mr. Woods expressed great sympathy but said
he was sorry but his duty to me, the author, prevented
him from doing as they requested. The next day the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>gentlemen returned to say that the Tong had informed
them that they had slightly altered their plan and now
proposed if the play continued to kill Mr. Woods.
Al said that it was a lousy play anyway and he had
never liked it, but a statement from Pittsburgh showing
a big profit calmed him sufficiently to enable him
to defy the Tongs to do their worst.</p>

<p class='c013'>The next day letters with death heads began to arrive
and as these failed to ruffle his majestic calm a
voice, speaking broken English, called him on the telephone
and informed him that if the play was performed
even once after the following Saturday night
his body would be found in the East River the following
Monday. As Mr. Woods’ body is still to be found
comfortably seated in his office at the Eltinge Theatre,
it is not difficult to deduct his reaction to that voice—we
closed.</p>

<p class='c013'>For eight years the Stair and Havlin Circuit, as the
string of popular-priced theaters that extended across
the United States was called, were amazingly prosperous
and in their rise, their prosperity and their decline,
I should like to trace an analogy between them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>and the motion picture industry of the present day—in
the nature of a warning and a prophecy.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the eight years of which I am writing the
average business of these theaters was definitely fixed
at about three thousand five hundred dollars a week.
The fluctuations of business were nominal, the people
wanted our shows, just as to-day there is a fixed demand
for talking pictures, not for a good picture,
although already one may see evidences of discrimination
on the part of the public which, I fear, the picture
companies are no more prepared to gratify than
we of the old popular-priced theater were in our day.
All we had to do was to see that our weekly running
expense came to five hundred dollars less than our
share of the take—then multiply this by forty, as the
houses were open forty weeks a year, and we had a
profit of twenty thousand a year from each show.</p>

<p class='c013'>During each of these years we had from seven to
thirteen plays of my writing on this circuit.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Then one day—and let me call the attention of the
rulers of the motion picture business to this—Mr.
Woods and I were struck by a great notion. “We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>will,” we said, “increase this average business of $3,500
by putting out a show so much bigger than any of the
others that we can safely count on over-capacity business
to pay our increased expense and yield us a greater
than average profit.”</p>

<p class='c013'>No sooner said than done. <span class='sc'>Nellie, the Beautiful
Cloak Model</span> took to the road and played for a year
to an average of four thousand dollars a week. What
could be more natural than to continue the good
work? The next season we put out three more “big
shows” and allowed them to cost us about thirty percent
more than our old average of expense. By this
time our rivals, attracted by the reports of our big business
with our “Super-Specials” began to compete for
this added revenue and produced a flock of “Super-Specials”
which in a season, since all things are comparative,
educated the public to expect “big shows.”
Thus, the average show now costs a sum of money
that could only be drawn by an extraordinary show,
and in three years the popular-priced theater business
was dead.</p>

<p class='c013'>Naturally, the advance of the pictures had something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>to do with our defeat, but neither then nor now
can the decline of the theater be fairly laid to the fact
that the public prefers the motion picture to the drama.
All of the ills of the theater in my time are due directly
to the folly, the ignorance and the greed of the
theatrical manager. I have many life-long friends
among these men; among them are men of fine principle
and honest intentions, but the composite manager
has always been the stumbling block in the way
of our progress. We tried to fight the advancing wave
of motion pictures with dirty, ill-lighted theaters, bad-mannered
attendants and arrogant box-office men, and
we lost, as we deserved to lose.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a popular idea that the theatrical manager
failed at his job because he allowed his artistic soul
to overwhelm his natural business instincts. In my
humble opinion he failed because he usually had no
artistic soul at all and no business instincts. I know
of about five managers of the last decade who were
what I would call business men, and I am prepared to
offer a silver cup for the names of any others.</p>

<p class='c013'>The arrogance of the old-time manager, to whom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>actors and authors were slaves and chattels, has gone,
and although I was one of those who fought for their
passing I have not as yet become reconciled to their substitutes.
The best men of to-day are still the men who
were the best of the old order and if some of their
old power is gone I can’t help feeling that with it went
much of the old glamour and romance of the theater.</p>

<p class='c013'>This writing rubber stamp stories by formula was
the main cause of the collapse of the Stair and Havlyn
Circuit and is the only real reason for to-day’s depression
in the New York theater. There is always an
audience for a good play, but unfortunately there isn’t
always a good play for an audience. Just as every
good play produced stimulates theatergoing, so does
every bad play produced discourage it, and when the
bad plays outnumber the good by too great a proportion
the public naturally becomes very cautious. We
figure of late in the theater that only one play out of
seven produced is even moderately successful, which
when you come to think of it isn’t so much the public’s
lack of interest as it is the playwright’s lack of
skill.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>When a man has spent time and money to see six
terrible plays one after the other it isn’t surprising that
his eagerness is somewhat cooled. If it were possible
to bring into New York this season fifteen fine plays
we should hear no more talk about hard times in the
theater. Unfortunately it isn’t possible.</p>

<p class='c013'>Under the present conditions the demand for good
plays has little effect upon the supply partly because
good plays are hard to write and even more because we
are not in agreement as to what constitutes a good play.</p>

<p class='c013'>The novelist often succeeds upon his literary style,
a painter by his drawing and his sense of color, but
paradoxically enough a good play is a bad play unless
the writer has been fortunate in the choice of his subject
matter; skill alone won’t save him. Since the only
real standard by which one may judge a play is the
rather primitive one of whether one likes it or not, it
is easy to see how dangerous a game this play writing
is. A good workman may work his heart out for
many months to be condemned at last by the same
feeling that gave birth to the old doggerel “I do not
like you, Doctor Fell.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>Few critics are clever enough to make the distinction
between a writer’s skill and his good or evil fortune
in the choice of his subject, and I am often
amused to read the praises of the genius of an author
who has been lucky enough to hit upon a theme or
story that has tickled the public’s fancy and the complete
damnation of the poor wretch who has failed
to do so, although in every other particular the later
play may be ten times as well built and well written
as the former. Naturally we like to be amused and
resent being bored. Yet, as a matter of truth, the same
skill, the same hard work and the same knowledge
of life and of play structure goes into a man’s failures
as he puts into his successes. The writer who knows
his trade fails or triumphs the hour he makes his decision
of what he is going to write about. Then, too,
the subject matter of plays is still far too often dictated
by the manager and between us we are still getting
ourselves into trouble trying to guess what the
public wants instead of trying to do the best work we
know how to do and letting it go at that. The old
notion that the experienced showman knows more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>about plays than our present public knows dies hard
and many of our plays are still being written by and
for an intelligence distinctly below the average intelligence
of the audience.</p>

<p class='c013'>The day of the routine comedy-drama and melodrama
is over. The successful play of to-day is nine
times out of ten a good play. In fact the most encouraging
thing about the theater to-day is not that
good plays are sure of success but that bad plays are
sure of failure. An optimist may look happily forward
to the time when writers and managers who remain
blind to the change in public taste and persist
in producing routine sugar-coated piffle will all have
starved to death or been driven out of the business.</p>

<p class='c013'>This change has come about very gradually, as immigration
has been restricted and the living standards
of the American people have advanced. Life to-day
is stimulating where once it was, at least for the majority,
dull and uneventful. Romance, once supplied almost
wholly by the theater, is all about us. Modern
thought, modern invention, have done much to end
the bland acceptance of routine fiction, both on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>stage and on the printed page, and to be sure of an
audience to-day one must have something to say and
know how to say it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course, I am writing now of twenty years ago
but even then the change was coming and in a way
I was alive to it. I am, at this point, quite willing to
admit that I frequently turn out work far beneath the
standard that my observation tells me is necessary for
success, and that to-morrow I am quite as apt to start
frantically at work on an untrue and obsolete theme
as any novice. There are writers who are under the
control of their own critical faculty, but unfortunately
for me I have never been one of them. A story pops
into my head. Often I know it has no importance at
all and sternly shut it out. But, as is often the case,
if the story keeps coming back of its own free will I
usually end by forgiving it its obvious faults and gradually
working myself up into a lather of paternal
pride.... Who ever saw a young mother whose
baby didn’t seem remarkable to her? These yarns of
mine seem good to me because they are mine. If any
one else was to ask my opinion of the same story I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>would say it was terrible, but by the time I have lived
with it for a month or so I see beauty in it, because
I am looking at it hoping to see that beauty.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a matter of fact, one of the greatest differences
between a good play and a bad one is that a good play
says what the writer thinks it says, while a bad one
doesn’t. Play writing is really an extraordinary difficult
art; if all that was necessary for an emotion to
reach an audience was for the writer to feel that emotion,
we would have few failures. It is quite possible
for a writer to be honestly affected by the sorrows of
a character without the audience in the least sharing
his feeling. I have often wept as I wrote a scene that
never in the least affected any one besides myself. I
have chuckled over many a farce situation that never
got a laugh. A playwright’s words and his situations
must have that strange power that will project them
over the footlights. This projecting force is made up
of instinct, experience, sincerity and a queer sense of
rhythm, the timing of the dramatist.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I am asked how much play writing may be
taught I always hesitate. A lot may be taught—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>the right person—very little to the one without the instinctive
ear—the sense of pace and build that must
be there, although just exactly what it is and where
it comes from I find it difficult to explain.</p>

<p class='c013'>I dug up recently, out of my files, one of the first
plays I ever wrote, and was amazed at its crudity, but
even more amazed by the lilt of it; its pace, its timing
and its gradual accumulation to its crescendo were as
deft and as sure as anything I could write to-day ...
and at the time I wrote it these things were entirely
instinctive. One may learn a lot about what not to
write, may learn much of literary style and taste and
many of the tricks of construction, but I doubt if any
one without the instinctive feel of the born dramatist
can learn how to time a speech or pitch a climax and
without this all the rest is useless.</p>

<p class='c013'>Many of the greatest novelists, both of the past and
the present, have failed utterly when they tried to
write for the theater. Often they were far better writers
than any dramatist I know. They knew as much
about moods and character as any of us—but their
words won’t play, no one can act their scenes.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Few persons realize how vital this instinctive timing
is to a play. Bartley Campbell, a dramatist of the old
school, was a master of it. His old drama, <span class='fss'>THE WHITE
SLAVE</span>, was quite as lyric as any song. The late Charles
Kline could time a climax so deftly that, although
“the big scene” of <span class='fss'>THE LION AND THE MOUSE</span> hardly
makes sense when you read the words, it was impossible
not to be thrilled by them when you heard them
spoken.</p>

<p class='c013'>The writer of the old school was more dependent
upon this instinctive timing than the writer of to-day,
but even now the man or woman who writes for the
theater must write “good theater” no matter how
sound may be his philosophy. Instinct and emotion
will, I think, always be more vital to success than
literary style or even good sense and logic.</p>

<p class='c013'>To-day a writer must avoid the conventions just
as yesterday he had to abide by them, and in this difference
lies the distinction between the old school and
the new. In the days of which I am writing, the characters
of our popular-priced plays were as sturdily
founded upon a conventional mold as the most dogmatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>creed of the most narrow-minded religious
fanatics of the day, and any stepping aside upon a
more flowery path was sternly frowned upon. The
good play maker of the popular-priced theater was
supposed to know what a proper list of characters for
a play must be and any departure from that accepted
list was taken as a sign of the bad workman.</p>

<p class='c013'>In my day the list ran as follows:</p>
<p class='c012'>1. <span class='sc'>Hero.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>The hero was either poor or else very young and
very drunk. If sober and wealthy he automatically
became a villain. Wild young men with wealthy
fathers might do in a pinch—they could be reformed
by the heroine in the third act, and in this lady’s company,
in the last act, they could receive the father’s
blessing and the keys to the cellar, or whatever best
represented the family fortune. I was, however, never
very strong for the rich young man type of hero, well
knowing how much closer to the hearts of the audience
the honest working man type was sure to be.
Brave this hero must always be, and strong and kind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>but it was unfortunately difficult for him to be wise,
as the burden of troubles it was necessary to load upon
this poor man’s shoulders, by way of dramatic suspense,
would never have been carried by any one but
a terrible sap.</p>
<p class='c012'>2. <span class='sc'>Heroine.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>If the hero was extremely poor, it was possible for
her to be extremely wealthy, but by far the safest bet
was to make her the daughter of an honest working
man. In these days the young girls who went to the
popular-priced theaters were not themselves employed
to any extent as clerks or stenographers, and they knew
more about factory life and the experience of the day
laborer and less about the white collar workers than
they know to-day. Our heroine must be pure at any
cost, or else she must die. There could be no temporizing
with the “the wages of sin are death” slogan.
In all my experience I never once saw it successfully
defied. The heroine must, of course, always marry
the hero. Our audiences would not stand for any but
a happy ending with love and wealth bestowed upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>the girl. This was bad art, but it always seemed to
me to be pretty good sense, as the theater to them
meant not life as it was but life as they wanted it to
be, and the young girl in our audiences who thrilled
for an hour over the wealth and luxury and the ideal
love that always came to the fictitious character she
had for a time exchanged places with had little chance
of remaining in this fairyland for long.</p>
<p class='c012'>3. <span class='sc'>The Heavy Man.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>Always wealthy; the silk hat was his badge of office.
In a good melodrama he never reformed, he bit the
dust. He was the most absurd thing connected with
these old plays. The necessity for his evil plotting
was so great that even the most innocent of audiences
must have frequently wondered why he was not poisoned
at an early age by his own unfortunate disposition.
As a matter of fact, one of the principal
causes of the death of this form of entertainment
was the “Desperate Desmond” cartoons that instructed
our public in the absurdity of this stock
character.</p>
<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>4. <span class='sc'>The Heavy Woman.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>There were two of her, the haughty lady of wealth
and social position, quite naturally the instinctive
enemy of our audiences, and the “bad woman” who
in these days was spoken of in a hushed whisper. I
recall some successful heavy women who had dark
hair, but these were always cast in the society women
parts. The real bad ones had to be blondes and they
averaged a good hundred and sixty pounds.</p>
<p class='c012'>5. <span class='sc'>The Soubrette.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>A working girl with bad manners and a good heart.
Laurette Taylor was one of the best of these I ever
saw. This type of part, the real soubrette, has disappeared
from our theater, and yet some of the best
actresses I have ever known were soubrettes,—Maggie
Mitchell, Minnie Palmer, Mrs. Fiske (when she was
Minnie Maddern) and a host of others.</p>
<p class='c012'>6. <span class='sc'>The Comedian.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>Either Jew, Irish or German, the most important
member of the company in the old days and the one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>who drew the largest salary. We might and, as a
matter of fact, we frequently did get away with a terrible
leading man, but the comedian had to be good.</p>
<p class='c012'>7. <span class='sc'>The Light Comedy Boy.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>This character was always a humble and faithful
friend of the lovers and was always in love with the
soubrette. I recall once trying to have this character
in love with some one else—but I had to rewrite the
play. The audience got too bewildered.</p>
<p class='c012'>8. <span class='sc'>The Second Heavy.</span></p>

<p class='c013'>He was just a bum, a tool of the villain’s, and as it
was usual to kill him along toward the middle of the
second act, we never found it necessary to engage a
very good actor.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>These eight made up the cast and to them we added
two or three utility actors to play such “walking parts”
as the plot demanded, but no matter what the play
these eight characters were always in it. If they hadn’t
been I am sure the audience would have demanded
their money back.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Scenically, these plays of ours were very elaborate.
They were always in four acts and frequently with as
many as five scenes in each act. <span class='fss'>CHINATOWN CHARLIE</span>
had twenty-two scenes. The mechanical dexterity demanded
in writing a play of this kind was very important
and an extremely difficult trick to acquire.
Front scenes in the old melodramas were always flat
and stupid, just as they are in the musical comedies
of to-day. The expert workman let his front scenes
run the exact time it took the stage carpenters to set
the next scene back of it and not a moment longer,
which took experience and care. It was also necessary
to climax these scenes and these scene climaxes
were the forerunners of the modern “blackout”—some
sure-fire “belly-laugh” or bit of heroic bunk that would
be sure to bring a yell of delight from the audience
to cover the moment in the dark necessary to fly the
drop and start the next scene.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a time I got to be so expert in this that I could
give a cue to the audience for a laugh or a yell of
approval that would last just long enough to fill in
the desired pause. To me the most interesting thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>about these old manuscripts of mine are these “audience
cues” that would be meaningless to any one
who should chance to read them but were a very real
and very necessary part of the play.</p>

<p class='c013'>Just how I could have been quite serious in building
these old plays I can’t at this moment quite comprehend,
but the fact is that I was, just as every man
who is successful in his work must be. Even the priceless
line of Nellie, the well-known cloak model, was
quite gravely written. Nellie was endeavoring to escape
from the attentions of a very evil gentleman who
from the start of the play showed signs of paying her
attentions that were far from honorable. In the first
act he pushed her under a descending elevator in the
basement of a department store. In Act II he threw
her off Brooklyn Bridge and in the third he bound her
to the tracks of the elevated railroad just as a train
came thundering along. In the fourth act he climbs
in her bedroom window at an early hour of the morning
and when both modesty and prudence force her
to shrink away from him he looked at her reproachfully
and said: “Why do you fear me, Nellie?”</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>────────────────<br />CHAPTER V <span class='small'>◆</span> UP FROM MELODRAMA<br />────────────────</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>About 1911 I saw the fate of the popular-priced
game, and got out of it before the final crash, as
did Sam Harris, Al Woods and a few of the others.
I started to look about for a new way of earning my
living. I had made money at the game and was in
no danger from that source, but I was then, in 1910,
only thirty-seven years old and had trained myself to
the habit of almost constant work, a habit I have never
as yet been able to break.</p>

<p class='c013'>My name, as the author of literally hundreds of
bloodthirsty melodramas, was a thing of scorn to the
highbrows of the theater, used as a horrible example
to young authors and to frighten bad children. The
very thought of my being allowed to produce a play
in a Broadway theater was quite absurd, as my friends
all assured me. I kept on writing, however, for the
same reason that keeps me at it now, because I love
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>to write plays, no matter whom it hurts. For a year
or two I had a tough time, but I managed to find a
market among the road stars and the one night stand
companies, and I wrote a few comedies and dramatized
several novels. They were successful enough in
the towns where they were played but were never
heard of in New York. At this time, also, I developed
a trick of writing plays directly for stock companies
and by good salesmanship built up quite an income
from this by-product. I was absolutely bound to break
into the New York game and in spite of many rebuffs
I kept knocking at the doors of the New York managers.</p>

<p class='c013'>The doors of New York managers, however, were
closely guarded, even in the comparatively far-off days
of which I am writing, and in the season of 1910 the
best I could manage to do, aside from my usual flock
of road shows and my growing list of plays popular
with the stock companies at that time successfully scattered
all over the country, was to secure a couple of
matinée performances. As a matter of fact, a matinée
performance of the play of a new author is simply a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>public announcement by the manager of his lack of
faith and neither of these efforts of mine came to
much. The first of these, <span class='fss'>THE WISHING RING</span>, was produced
by Lee Shubert at Daly’s with Marguerite Clark
and a supporting company thrown together from the
cast of a musical play at that time current in the theater.
Marguerite Clark was charming in the part and
later made use of the play on the road and produced
it for a short run in Chicago. <span class='fss'>THE WISHING RING</span> was
directed by Cecil De Mille and was, I think, the last
thing he did before he left New York and threw in
his lot with the picture people.</p>

<p class='c013'>The second of these half-hearted matinée productions
was made for me by Daniel Frohman at the
Lyceum and gave Laurette Taylor one of her first
chances to show her very extraordinary talent. This
play, <span class='fss'>LOLA</span>, was a queer sort of fish, part crude melodrama
and part a very real and very fine example of
good play writing, but it was one of those plays of
which one must say it is either great or absurd. My
shady reputation and the hasty and careless production
made only one answer probable. In fact, it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>many years before the name of Owen Davis was much
of a help to a play, and it would probably have taken
me at least a thousand to establish a trade-mark as a
serious dramatist had the public known that aside
from the crimes committed under the name of Owen
Davis I must also answer to many others. I had fallen
into the playful habit of inventing other names to hide
my evil deeds. At one time I used so many assumed
names that the mere invention of them became a
task and Al Woods used to help me out by calmly
borrowing the name of one of his clerks or stenographers
and writing it down as author of my latest
thriller.</p>

<p class='c013'>When <span class='fss'>CONVICT 999</span> was first produced in Pittsburgh,
the dramatic critic of the largest of the morning
papers said in his review of the play: “Here at
last is a fine melodrama and heaven be praised. Here,
in the person of John Oliver, a new writer, we have
at last found a man who knows more about how to
write a play of this kind than the irrepressible Owen
Davis ever knew.”</p>

<p class='c013'>William A. Brady was the first to give me a regular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>Broadway production with a first class company and
in doing so, although he little knew it at the time, he
started an association that lasted for many years. Mr.
Brady is a strong man and had he been able to foresee
what was in store for him the day on which we
signed our first contract, it is highly probable these
confessions would never have been written. With
great confidence, however, Mr. Brady commanded me
to write him a big melodrama and as a result Doris
Keane and William Courtney appeared in a direful
thing called <span class='fss'>MAKING GOOD</span>. The title of this play
turned out to be a god-send to the New York critics
and if I had put as much wit into my play as they
put into their slaughter of it, Mr. Brady and I would
have been happier even if they had been deprived of
a great pleasure. As a matter of fact, I should be a
very popular man with the critics. Several of them
owe their standing as humorists almost entirely to me
and at least one of the finest of them, Frank O’Malley,
won his place in the ranks of humorists over my dead
body.</p>

<p class='c013'>In later years Mr. O’Malley confided to me that he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>often journeyed miles to get to a play of mine, a compliment
that at the time I quite failed to value at its
true worth.</p>

<p class='c013'>Twenty-four hours after the first New York production
of <span class='fss'>MAKING GOOD</span> I was safely hidden in the
country with my still loyal wife and two small sons,
luckily at the time too young to know their shame.
At once I started out, quite undismayed, to write another.
One old habit that still clings to me: if I have
a failure, to sit down at my desk before I have so much
as slept on it, and write at least part of the next one;
as a matter of fact, most of the good plays I have written
have been started at such a time. Here then, in
the wilds of Westchester, I stuck to it until I finished
<span class='fss'>THE FAMILY CUPBOARD</span>, much the best thing I had
done up to then, and a play that might very well be
a success if produced to-day. The manuscript of this
play I sent at once to a play-broker with instructions
to offer it for production with no author’s name on
the manuscript. A few days later the broker called
me up with the startling information that he had sold
my play to William A. Brady—rather dread news as,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>following what the New York critics had said about
<span class='fss'>MAKING GOOD</span>, Mr. Brady had thrown me out of his
office and practically forbidden me its sacred ground.</p>

<p class='c013'>It seemed, so my broker said, that Mr. Brady had
paid good money for an option on the play and was
very curious as to the identity of the modest author.
When he learned it, he had something very like a
stroke, but in time he forgave me.</p>

<p class='c013'>All the years I worked with Mr. Brady were punctuated
by terrible fights between us that always ended
in a renewal of friendship and affection. He is by
far the most colorful figure in the American theater
and even when one disagrees with him, which is apt
to be rather often, his strength and his complete belief
in his own opinion cause his opponents awful moments
of doubt. If Mr. Brady really set out to convince
me that a red apple was a yellow one, I should
at once go and order a new pair of glasses.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Brady, David Belasco and Daniel Frohman are
the last of the old guard and, each in his different way,
has written his name boldly on the pages of our drama.
Different as these three men are they have one thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>in common: a great and abiding love of the theater
and its people.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Brady and I together did <span class='fss'>THE FAMILY CUPBOARD</span>,
<span class='fss'>SINNERS</span>, <span class='fss'>FOREVER AFTER</span>, <span class='fss'>AT 9.45</span> and many
others. <span class='fss'>FOREVER AFTER</span> was Alice Brady’s first big
part; partly owing to its simple, straightforward love
story and partly to her fine performance, it turned
out to be one of the best money-makers I have ever
had. These plays were at the moment my idea of
one step up from the <span class='fss'>NELLIE, THE BEAUTIFUL CLOAK
MODEL</span> of the Al Woods days.</p>

<p class='c013'>At about this time the Actors’ Equity Association
was formed and pulled a real battle for their rights
against the absurd and vicious standards of the business.
That they won that battle is well-known and
that they deserved to win it is fully admitted by fair-minded
and honest managers of the Sam Harris type—although,
of course, if all managers had been of his
type no fight would have been necessary.</p>

<p class='c013'>The actors’ strike at this time closed all the theaters
and, as usual, the author, who wasn’t in the fight at
all and had nothing to win whatever the outcome, lost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>much more money than any actor and rather resented
the row being pulled in his front yard. Most authors
were in sympathy with the actors but I know that for
one I wished they had chosen to fight with some other
weapons than my three plays, the runs of which were
interrupted and from which I had been drawing a very
considerable royalty.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hit in the dramatist’s tenderest spot, we met and
organized and from that day to this many of my hours
have been given up to service to the authors’ societies.
I was at that time the last president of the old Society
of American Dramatists and Composers and a member
of the Authors’ League. With the help of a handful
of ardent spirits, I brought all the active dramatists
of the day into the old society and merged it with
the Authors’ League as the Dramatists’ Guild of the
Authors’ League of America. A group of strong men
and women came to the front and served faithfully
on hundreds of committees and through long hours of
conferences. Among the most active of these were
Augustus Thomas, James Forbes, Gene Buck, Rupert
Hughes, Channing Pollock, Edward Childs Carpenter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>Percival Wilde, Rachel Crothers, Ann Crawford
Flexner, Jules Goodman and Montague Glass; then
later Arthur Richman, George Middleton and William
Cary Duncan and a number of others.</p>

<p class='c013'>I remained as president of this group until I resigned
to take up the presidency of the Authors’ League and
gave, as all these others gave, a very considerable part
of my life for many years. At present, thanks to our
efforts, the dramatists are as well organized as the actors
and like the actor eager at all times for a battle,
but we are unfortunately quite without an adversary,
one of the peculiar things about the manager
being that he is unable to agree to anything whatever
that any other manager thinks would be a good
thing.</p>

<p class='c013'>At meetings of the managerial society one man will
frequently say: “I don’t know what Mr. Blank wants
to do about this problem, but anything he thinks I
think different.” It is a truly tragic thing that the
men who should be the leaders of the great institution
that the American theater should be have been incapable
of enough business foresight to bind themselves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>firmly together to protect their interests. Always we
have been out-generaled by the motion picture men,
bled white by the ticket speculator and discriminated
against by the railroads, the labor unions, and even the
newspapers, who are by rights our natural allies and
our traditional friends. If the theater is the cultural
and the educational force I have always claimed it
was, surely it has a right to public loyalty and support
and I must always think that, if we have in large part
lost that support, it is because the dignity and the importance
of the drama has been hidden by the lack of
dignity and the lack of importance of many of our
leaders.</p>

<p class='c013'>I thought these things in the time of which I am
now writing, 1912-1913, but naturally I had neither
the independence of age nor circumstance at that time
to dare to fully express myself. Just before the war
I had begun to be impatient of the machine-made
plays I had been writing for so long and began to listen
to my wife’s pleadings to cut down the quantity
and try to improve the quality of my work. She had
been begging me to do this for ten years or more, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>like other good husbands I rather like to do any little
thing my wife asks of me—after she has been asking
it for ten years. I really think I wanted to please her,
but I also think that I had by this time outgrown the
sentimental comedy-drama as once before I had outgrown
the cheap melodramas. Naturally enough as
soon as I lost my own belief in my form of expression
I was no longer successful in it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let no man go unchallenged who in your presence
talks of purposely “writing down” to an audience, or
of “giving them what they want” or any other fish-bait
of that description. I am here to tell you that no
man ever successfully wrote or produced any play, or
any novel below his own mental level at the moment.
When I wrote <span class='fss'>NELLIE, THE BEAUTIFUL CLOAK MODEL</span>,
I was honestly deeply moved by the lady’s many misfortunes
or I couldn’t have put it over, and when I
wrote the comedy-dramas that followed it I truly believed
in them or no audience in the world would have
sat through them. This is always true, I think, of
writers or of managers. We are entirely emotional
people and our work reflects us. I know of several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>supremely successful producers who made great fortunes
selling the piffle they loved and who, as soon as
their money brought them contacts that resulted in
an increase in their taste and knowledge promptly
appointed themselves judges of the drama and even
more promptly went broke.</p>

<p class='c013'>You may well afford to laugh at the faker who
boasts of skill great enough to assume a mood and
color different from his own. The next time he tells
you of how he “wrote down to the boobs” simply tell
him he is either a liar or a fool—probably both. For
surely, if he is not a liar, he must be the greatest fool
on earth to use for a cheap success a genius great
enough to have brought him a real one.</p>

<p class='c012'>If then, about fifteen years ago, I wanted to write
a higher form of drama it was for no nobler reason
than because I had begun to be bored by the sort of
work I was doing and because it bored me it had begun
to bore my audiences. Several times in my life I have
been driven to an advance of this sort and always because
of the fact that I found my old occupation gone.
As time goes on, I have come to believe that if I could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>live two or three hundred years I might develop into
quite a playwright. In any case I once more threw
my box of tricks away and sat down quietly and tried
to study out a new method. In this I was helped by
the change that had begun to come over the drama.
I was influenced as all our writers were at the time by
the Russian and Hungarian dramatists who had discarded
the artificial form of the “well-made play” and
were writing a new form of photographic realism that
tempted us all to follow in their footsteps.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a result I wrote <span class='fss'>THE DETOUR</span>, which remains in
my mind the example of the best work I have done
for the theater. Of all my plays the <span class='fss'>DETOUR</span>, <span class='fss'>THE
GAMBLER OF THE WEST</span> (one of the old melodramas
of the Al Woods days) and <span class='fss'>THE NERVOUS WRECK</span> are
my pets. <span class='fss'>THE DETOUR</span> was produced by Lee Shubert
at the Astor Theatre in the early fall of 1921 and, although
it was never a money-maker, it gave me what
I wanted and made my wife very happy. As she had
stuck around by this time for some fifteen years waiting
for something like this to happen, it was, to say
the least, no more than she deserved.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>In the production of <span class='fss'>THE DETOUR</span> I was fortunate
enough to be able to secure Augustin Duncan to play
the principal part and to stage the play. He more
than justified the confidence I had in him. To me
Mr. Duncan is a great artist and by far the most sincere
example of the man who puts his art above his
pocketbook I have ever met. I suppose more rot has
been spilled out by men and women who pose as “devoted
to their art” than by any other set of posing
hypocrites since the world began. We all of us play
the tune we know and to rebuke us for that tune is
as silly as it is to praise us for it. To use what talents
we may have to earn a decent living for ourselves and
those dependent upon us is, to a man of any philosophy,
a far finer thing than to sit in a Greenwich Village
attic and mouth jealous platitudes about the baseness
of commercial art.</p>

<p class='c013'>This statement of my opinion is neither a defense
nor an alibi. I myself, as these confessions of mine
are describing to you, have always written for the
love of the theater rather than from any art impulse
and I am the first to admit that my love of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>the theater has always been more compelling than
my love of the drama, if you follow me in the distinction.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a practical man, born of a practical line of hard-headed
Yanks, I have studied my own small talents
and developed them and tried to make up for a lack
of the real fires of genius by an honest admission of
that lack and a true enthusiasm for the work that at
the moment came nearest to expressing my attitude.
The true genius, the true artist, is very rare, but Augustin
Duncan is distinctly of that number. He is quite
as incapable of doing any work that doesn’t seem fine
to him as I am of writing anything at all unless I am
going to be paid for it, and he is as firm in his refusals
as I am. And in my life, during which I have written
several million words, I doubt if I have written five
thousand without practical reward.</p>

<p class='c013'>Max Gordon, one of the managers with whom I
have been associated, looked at me in troubled amazement
one day lately when I had made some mildly
humorous comment and said: “That’s the first time
I ever heard you say anything funny for less than ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>percent.” Max Gordon, like many others of my acquaintance,
assumes this attitude of mine to be
founded on a desire for money, but as a matter of fact
I care very little about money or the things that money
stands for. Any man who can make good can always
make money, but the fun is in the making good, in
the thrill and the sense of power that comes from
activities sanely thought out and successfully accomplished.
Under Mr. Duncan’s fine direction <span class='fss'>THE DETOUR</span>
was molded into shape and ready for its first
performance. Not one word of my original manuscript
was changed from the day I wrote it, which
fact is most amazingly to his credit rather than to
mine. He is so fine a director that he molded his
company to my play, rather than my play to his company—the
true duty of a director, although few of
them have the sense to know it. To the picture director
an author’s play is a sort of clover field in which
he loves to kick up his heels and romp about at his
own sweet will, making any changes at all that his
fancy may dictate, most of them being made for the
very simple reason that he doesn’t quite grasp the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>meaning of what is on the written page in front of
him. Even in the theater there are few managers who
realize the value of one man’s unbroken line of
thought. “Plays are not written, they are re-written”
is a motto often repeated to writers and in the old
days these wise words were proudly framed and hung
over the desk of one of our greatest producers. This
musty old truism has been used to slaughter plays during
all the years since Dion Boucicault first uttered it,
and like most other truisms its principal fault lies in
the fact that it isn’t true. When I was in Harvard
I met Mr. Boucicault in a barroom on Bowdoin Square
in Boston and, as I looked at him in awe and homage,
I had little thought of ever being bold enough to challenge
any of his theories. Dion Boucicault was a great
playwright of the eighties, a man of sound knowledge
of his craft, but like the best of us there were occasions
when he talked nonsense.</p>

<p class='c013'>Plays are written by their authors. They are good
plays or bad plays depending almost wholly upon the
degree of talent of the author plus his accident of
choice of a subject. This goes for pictures as well as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>for stage plays. The germ of success is put in only
by the original author in spite of Mr. Boucicault and
the combined opinion of the Managers’ Association
and the motion picture industry. I am stating here
an important fact upon which I have a great deal of
special information. I doubt if any man alive has ever
been called in as a play doctor more frequently than
I, and for the good of my soul I am willing to admit
that I have very rarely saved a patient. I have often
seen plays helped by careful and skillful revision but
I have never once seen a play built into a real success
unless the germ of that success was firmly planted by
the author in his first manuscript.</p>

<p class='c013'>Frequently I have seen, so frequently as to have
learned to be in dread and horror of the practice, sensitive
and beautiful plays and picture stories so coarsened
and debased by the rough hands of managers,
directors, supervisors and other quacks, that all hope
of success has been dosed and purged out of them.
I am stoutly of the opinion that if no changes at all
in original manuscripts were ever made the percentage
of success both in plays and pictures would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>infinitely higher. This does not in the least mean
that I think the author is always right. Of course
he isn’t. Play writing is the most difficult form of
all the forms of literary expression, and no man ever
wrote a perfect play. But I think the trained writer
knows more about his business than any one else can
hope to know, and I think it is as silly for an outsider
to meddle with his work as it would be for a kind
neighbor to write a few helpful words in the middle
of the prescription you have paid a physician to prescribe
for your sick child.</p>

<p class='c013'>Every one in the world is, I suppose, a potential
story-teller. I am constantly being asked to read plays
written by elevator boys, maid-servants, policemen and
taxi drivers, and it is not surprising that when a man
finds himself in power over a writer he should at once
demand a share of the joy of the creator. But to me
play writing is and scenario writing ought to be a definitely
understood and carefully studied profession; and
the outsider without special knowledge or special talent
who undertakes to turn out a masterpiece is in
exactly the same position to do good work as the Irishman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>who had never tried to play the violin but had
always thought he could do it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Even in editorial rooms, where a higher class of
intelligence is usually found in authority over the story
departments, one notices this instinctive urge to get a
finger into the pie and the theater is cursed with it;
as the picture business is superlative in all things this
very human failing may be found here in its fullest
flowering. Just as Tom Sawyer’s young friends all
wanted a turn at whitewashing the fence so do the
picture executives—supervisors, directors, script-girls,
cutters, film-editors, messenger boys, stage-hands and
scrub-women—all yearn to make just the least little
bit of a change in a story to satisfy some instinctive
lech to be an author. I have seen so many plays and
screen stories ruined by this enforced collaboration
that I honestly look upon it as the major evil that
threatens a young writer’s success.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the first place it’s a silly custom because once the
author surrenders the integrity of his story he is helpless
to even be a fair judge of the hybrid product that
takes its place, and as plays and stories do not succeed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>on account of their structural perfection but by virtue
of their spiritual and inspirational qualities, it is obvious
that no man without a creative talent has any
right to mess about with them.</p>

<p class='c013'>Duncan knew the folly of all this and his skill
and instinct resulted in a fine and sensitive performance.</p>

<p class='c013'>Again a play of mine was to have its first performance
at a holiday matinée and again, as had happened
to me during the first matinée of <span class='fss'>THROUGH THE
BREAKERS</span>, I was to be given the benefit of an honest
lay opinion of my talents. We opened in Asbury Park,
New Jersey, famous among people of the theater for
drawing the prize boob audiences of America. An
audience at any seashore resort is a terrible thing, but
in Asbury Park for some reason its reactions are amazing.
Good plays die and terrible plays are heralded
as great, so that the wise author simply sits in suffering
silence with cotton in his ears. Personally as I sat
with my wife through this first performance of <span class='fss'>THE
DETOUR</span> I had been very happy, so happy in fact that
I neglected the cotton, and on my way out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>crowded theater I heard the first critical opinion of
this, the first attempt on my part to write of life simply
and honestly. “Do you know,” remarked a very
pretty young woman as we passed, “I think I could
write a better play than this one myself.” In spite,
however, of this completely honest expression of opinion
<span class='fss'>THE DETOUR</span> gave me a new standing as a writer
of serious plays. Another rusty old saw of the trade
is the one about all the great plays resting in closets,
trunks and unread in managers’ offices, plays so fine
that, were they to be produced, a new drama would
spring full grown into being. I have been looking for
one of those for twenty years, but so far it has escaped
me. In all the hundreds of these neglected manuscripts
that it has been my sad fate to have read I found
just one real play. When I demanded a hearing for
it and got one, it turned out to be just fair. There is
a real utility about a great play that sooner or later
will bring it to the stage; some one will see it and
rave about it and it will get its chance. It isn’t so difficult
to tell a really great play when one reads it, or
a really bad play, it’s the in-between it is difficult to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>judge, the degree of badness or of value that means
failure or success. Careful reading of these supposed
masterpieces will usually prove rather a shock. I’ve
read a thousand, and I am not the man I was.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Great War was over by this time and the
changes it had brought about in our moods and our
standards was being sharply reflected in the theater.
The motion pictures, successful as they had grown to
be, had not as yet challenged our right to existence
and we had begun to produce something in the nature
of an American Drama. Eugene O’Neill had written
several fine plays. Arthur Richman’s <span class='fss'>AMBUSH</span>, Gilbert
Emery’s <span class='fss'>THE HERO</span> and my <span class='fss'>THE DETOUR</span> and
<span class='fss'>ICEBOUND</span> were at least a step toward a true folk
play and the rise of the Theatre Guild and of Arthur
Hopkins, who to me has always seemed the great
man of the theater in my time, gave fine promise
of fine things.</p>

<p class='c013'>The Great War had disturbed and sobered me. I
was about forty-two years old at the time America
entered it, fat, near-sighted and cursed with a gouty
constitution. Quite obviously I couldn’t fight, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>yet, like all men who stood just across the border line
from heroic action, I had my moments of longing and
resentment; here was a big thing and I couldn’t be
part of it. I had been a sort of adventurer all my life
and yet when the greatest adventure of all time was
going on I must stand on the side lines.</p>

<p class='c013'>Fate had decided that I was to have no real connection
with the war. I was too old, and my two boys
were too young. The nearest I came to the feeling of
personal participation was when my youngest brother,
Colonel, then Major, Robert P. Davis, sailed with his
regiment for France. My peace of mind received one
slight shock, however, when my oldest son, Donald,
then not quite fourteen, slipped away from Yonkers,
where we were living at the time, and enlisted in the
Navy. Exactly what might have come of that I never
will know, for when the young man was marched
with a squad of volunteers to the Battery and lined
up before the keen eye of an officer, he was rudely
yanked out of line and sent home to me with a stern
warning which frightened me very much but made
no dent at all in the culprit’s armor. He felt no repentance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>at all but furiously cursed the United States
Navy for not knowing a good man when they saw
one.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the war a writer faced a new world. The
changes in the form of play writing speak volumes of
the change in our mode of thought and our standards.
When I had written my first plays in the early nineties,
asides were freely spoken. I had frequently written
scenes in the old days in which the lovely heroine sat
calmly in a chair, violently struggling to pretend not
to hear the villain and his fellow conspirators who
plotted her undoing in loud voices at a distance of six
feet. The soliloquy was also in good usage, that marvelous
aid to the clumsy craftsman by which all necessity
for a carefully reticent exposition could be laughed
aside. I used to start a play, for example, with a lady
alone on the stage as the first curtain rose. She would
perhaps turn sadly away from the window and looking
the audience firmly in its composite eye would
exclaim: “Poor John; I wonder if he knows that I
have been untrue to him.” This naturally saved a
lot of time and had a distinct advantage from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>audience’s point of view. They had very little excuse
for not knowing what the play was all about.</p>

<p class='c013'>Deeper, however, than any change in the shifting
methods of play writing was the change in the point
of view of our audiences. The “Prodigal Son” story,
the “Cinderella” story, and the “Magdalen” story
seemed to have lost their power; the old one about,
“My son shall never marry a daughter of the Hoosis’s”
no longer bit very deep, and the poor dramatist had
to learn all over again.</p>

<p class='c013'>I can best explain the change that twenty years had
brought by telling of an experience I had with a play
called <span class='fss'>DRIFTWOOD</span>. I wrote this play in 1905 and read
it to a famous star of that time; the lady liked the
part and urged her manager to produce the play, but
after long reflection he decided against it on the
grounds that the heroine of my play had made in her
youth what the French writers so politely describe
as “a slip,” and in his experience it was out of the
question that any audience could ever be willing for
her, no matter how deep her repentance, to marry a
decent man. Twenty years after I dug this old faded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>manuscript out of a trunk and was struck by some
scenes of what seemed to me to be of real power and
truth, and again I took it to a great woman star, whose
verdict was “It didn’t seem to her to be about anything
worth making such a fuss about.” And she was as
right in her opinion as the manager of the old days
had been in his.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the production of <span class='fss'>THE DETOUR</span> I attacked my
work from a slightly different point of view, and my
next job was the very pleasant one of making for my
old friend, William A. Brady, the American adaptation
of <span class='fss'>THE INSECT COMEDY</span>, which was produced as
<span class='fss'>THE WORLD WE LIVE IN</span>. I followed this with <span class='fss'>ICEBOUND</span>,
which won for me the Pulitzer Prize in 1923
and caused me to be selected as a member of the
National Institute of Arts and Letters.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had some adventures with <span class='fss'>ICEBOUND</span> before I got
it on the stage and got myself into a terrible mess that
grew deeper as its success grew more assured. David
Belasco had seen <span class='fss'>THE DETOUR</span> and had written me that
if I could write another play as good he would gladly
produce it at once. I sent him the manuscript of <span class='fss'>ICE
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>BOUND</span> as soon as I completed it, and in a few days had
a telegram from him saying that he liked it very much
and asked me to see Mr. Roder, his manager, and arrange
the details of a contract. The next day I called
on Ben Roder, whom I had known for many years,
and he offered me a contract containing a clause giving
Mr. Belasco the right to produce the play at any
time during the next two years. Mr. Belasco was
away with David Warfield’s production of <span class='fss'>THE MERCHANT
OF VENICE</span> and Mr. Roder was a bit impatient
of my objection to the clause I have mentioned. I
have always been in a hurry all my life, and I had
caught from Al Woods during my long association
with him his ardent desire to see a play on the stage
the very moment he falls in love with it. Neither yesterday
nor to-morrow ever meant very much to me;
to-day has always been the right time to produce any
play that I had faith in. This fact is so well known
to the men with whom I do business that it is no longer
necessary for me to tell them that if they want to do
a play of mine at all they must start casting it the very
hour after they have first read it. Mr. Roder, however,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>was not quite used to my rather stormy manner, and
the result of our talk was an angry outburst on my
part.</p>

<p class='c013'>“Mr. Belasco,” I said, “will give me a contract before
noon on Monday for an immediate production
or he can’t have the play.” Such language is all out
of line in the Belasco office, and Mr. Roder smiled a
kindly and tolerant smile as I walked out of his office,
merely remarking that he didn’t think I was quite
crazy enough to turn down a Belasco production. I
have always been a free lance in the theater and perhaps
a bit militant in my stand for an author’s rights
and his prerogatives, and I made up my mind to go
through with my bluff unless Mr. Belasco came to my
terms. On Monday I would sell my play to some one
else. With this in view I took all four of my remaining
manuscripts under my arm, and by noon I had
placed three of them with managers of good standing,
in each case saying that the play must be purchased
by Monday noon or not at all, in each case walking
out of the office followed by an exact duplicate of Mr.
Roder’s tolerant but unbelieving smile.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>It was noon and I was hungry, so, with my remaining
manuscript tucked into my overcoat pocket, I
dropped into the grill room of the old Knickerbocker
Hotel for lunch. During lunch young Max Gordon,
whom I had known since his boyhood, sat down for a
moment at my table for a friendly chat. Max Gordon
and Al Lewis had been successful vaudeville agents
and had recently owned interests in several plays, but
as yet had made no productions under their own
names. Max was always of an inquiring turn of mind
and very little escapes him. One glance at the yellow
envelope sticking out of my overcoat pocket was
enough.</p>

<p class='c013'>“How’s your new play?” was his first start. His
second was to calmly stretch out his hand and take
my last manuscript out of my pocket and transfer it
to his own. “I’d like to read it,” he blandly observed,
and in spite of some protest on my part he walked
out of the room with it in his pocket. I had already
covered the three managers who, aside from Mr.
Belasco, had seemed to me to be best fitted to produce
this play and I went home. The next day being Saturday,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>I went up to St. Andrews for my usual week-end
game of golf with my golfing partner, Bob Davis,
Bob being no blood kin of mine but a very dear friend
of many years’ standing. Sunday morning the bell of
my apartment rang and Mr. Max Gordon walked
calmly in and dropped a thousand dollars on my table
and blandly announced that “we are going to produce
<span class='fss'>ICEBOUND</span>.” Questioned as to the “we” part
of it he replied that Sam Harris and Al Lewis had
read the play and that Mr. Harris had offered to put
it out under his trade mark with Lewis and Gordon
as silent but active partners. Sam Harris could then,
as he could now, have anything of mine he wanted,
so I promptly shook hands and called it a trade.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then the storm broke. By ‘phone, by letter and by
telegram every one of the managers whom I had given
until Monday noon to buy my play sent messages that
they would produce it, and it took me about five years
to square myself.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a matter of fact I have never been able to see the
justice in the trade custom of never submitting a play
to more than one manager at a time. If I own a house
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>and want to sell it, I give that house to more than one
agent, and the grocer who displays a particularly fine
melon on his stand doesn’t consider it the property
of the first customer who admires it. Before it’s anybody’s
but his some one must pay good money for it.
Experience has taught me that any manager who
wants a play never lets an author out of his office until
he has signed a contract, and he is crazy if he does.
I have been roused from my bed at four o’clock in
the morning and forced to promise a play to an excited
manager before he allowed me to crawl back
under the bedclothes, and any less ardent expression
of willingness has grown to be very suspicious in my
eyes.</p>

<p class='c012'>I first learned of the fact that <span class='fss'>ICEBOUND</span> had won
the Pulitzer Prize from Al Woods, who called me up
and told me the news. He was, I think, as much
excited as I, and perhaps he knew better than any one
else what a far cry it was from our old Bowery melodramas
to the winning of the prize for the best play
of 1923. A lot of water had flowed under the mill
in those twenty-five years, and to throw so completely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>aside a hard-won method and adopt another so radically
different was a very difficult thing. Since then I
have served several times on the committee to award
the prize, and I have never voted to give it to a dramatist
without recalling my own pleasure in listening
to Al Woods’ voice over the ‘phone when he called
up and said: “Listen, sweetheart, who do you think
cops the Pulitzer Prize this year?—you’d never guess—neither
would I—a guy told me—it’s you!”</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class='c012'>During the run of <span class='fss'>ICEBOUND</span> Bob Davis ruined a
golf game by telling me about a new story he was
about to publish. It was, so he told me, written by
E. J. Rath, but, as a matter of fact, it had in all probability
sprung from his own amazing mind, as have
literally hundreds of other stories that have appeared
under the names of our most famous writers. Bob
has been for many years the dry nurse of American
fiction and responsible for the present fame of more
successful novelists and short story writers than any
one man who has ever lived. This story that he called
<i>The Wreck</i> bored me very much and quite ruined my
game, as Bob usually saves his loudest and most startling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>statements until I am at the top of my back
swing; so to keep him quiet I told him to shut up
and I’d read the fool thing if he would send it to me.
When I read the proof sheets, all I could find there
was a very amusing character, but urged on by Bob
I finally agreed to try my best to make a play out of
it. The play was <span class='fss'>THE NERVOUS WRECK</span>, probably one
of the most successful farces of the last twenty years.</p>

<p class='c013'>As soon as I finished this play I took it to Sam Harris,
who read it promptly and told me it was terrible.
As I fully agreed with him, we decided to have it
tried out on the west coast, figuring that the further
we got it from the sight of our friends the better. Mr.
Harris had at that time some business relations with
Thomas Wilks of Los Angeles, and the play was announced
for production by him. After the first rehearsal
Mr. Wilks’ stock company went on strike and
refused to play the thing, saying that it was without
a doubt the worst play ever written by mortal man. It
was only after a battle that they were forced to
continue.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mr. Edward Horton who first played the part has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>since told me that he was never in his life so startled
as he was by the screams of laughter that followed his
first scene, and he and the leading lady got together
after the first performance and hastily learned their
lines, a thing that up to that time they had not thought
it worth while to do. The farce played in Los Angeles
for twelve weeks to enormous business, but Mr.
Harris and I were still a bit doubtful and rather reluctantly
started to put together a cast for an eastern
tryout. We put it on in Atlantic City with Mr. Horton
and Miss Frances Howard, now Mrs. Samuel
Goldwyn, in the leading parts. After the first performance
Mr. Harris confided in me that he had always
thought it the worst play he had ever seen and
that now he was sure of it. I had very little if any
more faith than he had, and we returned to New York
together in disgust. But to our amazement the fool
thing did a big week’s business and we decided to see
it once more during the following week in Long
Branch. At Long Branch we saw it before a half
empty house and decided we would close it up, and
that I would work on it at my leisure.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>I re-wrote it completely seven different times, and
each time Mr. Harris liked it just a little bit less. It
kicked around the office for a year before Al Lewis
picked it up in an idle moment and insisted on our
once again tempting fate with it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The third cast we selected for this outcast of ours
was headed by Otto Kruger and June Walker. Otto
said it was terrible and almost walked out on us, but
at last we got it on in Washington, where Mr. Harris
said he would come to see it with an unprejudiced eye.
This time he only remarked that he’d be damned if
he knew why he had ever bothered with the thing,
but if it was any fun for me to mess about with such
truck he had no objection to my seeing what I could
do. Messing about with a farce isn’t exactly fun, and
I almost killed myself working over it.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the next week in Baltimore, Mr. Harris
wired me that a failure at his New York theater was
leaving his house dark, and that he had booked <span class='fss'>THE
NERVOUS WRECK</span> to open there the following Monday.
By that time I had the play in pretty good shape. Al
Lewis, Sam Forrest and I had been at it night and day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>but I had no last act at all. A farce without a last
act is a pretty sad affair, and one night in desperation
I remembered a hot comedy scene I had in an
unproduced farce called <span class='fss'>THE HAUNTED HOUSE</span>. I
promptly pulled the scene bodily out of one play and
stuck it into another.</p>

<p class='c013'>This scene, the examination of some cowboys on a
ranch by a young eastern highbrow who used the
methods of laboratory psychology, made the play’s
success, but left me in an awful mess when the time
came to produce <span class='fss'>THE HAUNTED HOUSE</span>, which was now
without any last act at all. One act, however, has always
been a little thing in my life, and I stuck something
in the hole left by the missing scene, and with
the late Wallace Eddinger in the leading part, <span class='fss'>THE
HAUNTED HOUSE</span> did well enough for a season.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>────────────────<br />CHAPTER VI <span class='small'>◆</span> HOW TO WRITE THREE HUNDRED PLAYS<br />────────────────</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>I love farce, but of all the forms of dramatic writing
it is by all odds the most difficult and demands
more hard work and more technical dexterity of the
writer than any other.</p>

<p class='c013'>A good farce, in the first place, must have a plot
that could as easily be told as a tragedy, and a character
not only essentially true but completely familiar
to any audience; and it must have at least three times
as much situation in it as any other type of play.</p>

<p class='c013'>We hear a lot of late of the technique of play writing,
and I have grown a bit impatient of some of the
dogmatic drivel laid before the eyes of would-be dramatists.
In reality the dramatist sails on uncharted
seas. There is no master to whose word he can bow,
and no oracle to whom he can submit his questions.
The only way to write a good play is to make it good.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>If I were asked to put into one sentence the result
of my experience as a writer, I should say: “Dream
out a story about the sort of persons you know the
most about, and tell it as simply as you can.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course, rules for play writing don’t mean anything,
not even that the writer who lays down the
rules ever uses them himself. He may be like the
cook who prefers to go out to lunch, and yet I have
picked up one or two tricks, short cuts, easy ways to
do hard things, and I am going to write a few of them
down in the faint hope of their being of some slight
help to a beginner.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course, the usual way to learn to write is by
repeated failure, by doing almost everything so badly
that the awful consequences are so deeply burned into
one’s memory that each disaster has resulted in being
so terrified of one particular blunder that it can never
be repeated.</p>

<p class='c013'>Technique is, as I understand it, simply a facing of
certain facts, a realization of some mistakes, a summing
up of some experiences of one’s self or of others,
into an expressed formula. I think I believe in that.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>It is a good thing to know thoroughly all the rules of
play writing (only there really aren’t any). These
rules, the result of one’s own experience or the theories
of others should be carefully learned, and then twice
as carefully forgotten. Conscious technique in any
art is very painful. The sculptor knows that under
his clay are the trusses to hold up his figure, but he
doesn’t let them show. It might be well to note, however,
that if he forgot to put them in, his beautiful
figure would be a shapeless mass on the floor.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course, the man who knows the most about play
writing doesn’t write the best plays, but quite as surely
knowing a little about his trade isn’t going to hurt
him. I quarrel sometimes with my friend, M. L. Malevinsky,
over the real value of this special knowledge.
To me play writing is almost entirely an emotional
thing, and in the foreword I wrote for his quite remarkable
book on <span class='fss'>THE TECHNIQUE OF THE DRAMA</span> I
tried to express my feeling of the limitations of technical
knowledge by writing: “It is probable that the
hedge sparrow has quite as much technique as the
meadow lark, but only the song bird can sing.”</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>If you care to read the few observations I am about
to write down, read them with the thought that they
aren’t meant to be too slavishly followed; they are
not words of wisdom at all, they are simply scars
from the battlefield, and they are only meant as a
sort of protective mechanism to save your fingers
from being burned as deeply as my own have
been.</p>

<hr class='c014' />

<p class='c013'>1. Don’t write at all until you have something you
are sure is worth writing about.</p>

<p class='c013'>2. Don’t make notes. Anything one may possibly
forget isn’t worth remembering.</p>

<p class='c013'>3. After your story has shaped itself in your mind,
tell it to yourself over and over and over again—then
try it on some one else. Wives are good; they have
to stand for it. Let the first thing you put down on
paper be an outline narrative of your play, written in
two hundred words. If your story won’t go into two
hundred words, throw it away. The next step is to
write several more outlines, at first in narrative form.
Later put in a little dialogue, not probably to be used
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>in your final copy, but to give you a growing acquaintance
with your characters.</p>

<p class='c013'>4. Modern plays are about how characters react to
situations, not about situations in themselves.</p>

<p class='c013'>5. Be absolutely sure of your last scene before you
write a word of your first act. Paul Potter, a master
of the form of play writing, was the first to tell me
that the French dramatists always wrote their last act
first. I have never quite done that, but I do try to
know exactly what I am going to do with my characters
at the end of the play before I start out. One of
the oldest mechanical rules of play writing is, Act 1
plus Act 2 equal Act 3. I have altered that a little in
my own work, and I think I could express it as: the
characters of Act 1 multiplied by the emotions of Act
2 equal Act 3. A play really is a character driven by
an emotion along a definite line to a definite end. Mr.
Malevinsky states somewhat the same thing. I fully
agree with him that every play expresses a definite
emotion, but I do not think the author is or should
be conscious of the fact. In the end any carefully
written play results in a story line marked out by one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>character, driven by one dominant emotion to the definite
climax of that emotion—success, failure, love,
death, whatever it may be. But if one wants a successful
play, it must have an ending absolutely made
imperative by what has happened in the first part of
your story, plus what has happened in the second part.
If two-thirds of the way through you have a possible
choice as to the outcome, you will have a failure every
time. Authors write first acts and second acts, but
the audience writes all good last acts. A modern audience
cares very little whether your play ends happily
or not, but they insist upon its ending along the line
you yourself have started it on, and audiences know a
lot more about play writing than any dramatist ever
knew.</p>

<p class='c013'>6. Don’t try to tell of the sort of life you don’t know
anything about. If you know the little girl next door,
tell a story about her—forget the King of France.</p>

<p class='c013'>7. If, after you have written a speech, and read it
over and find it sounds very beautiful to you, cross it
out; beauty in the modern play is in the thought, not
in the words. This is a tough lesson for us old-timers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>to learn, and to this day the last thing I do before I
send my manuscript on its first journey is to comb
it over for stray “effective speeches” or bits of bombast,
once my specialty and now my bitterest enemy.</p>

<p class='c013'>8. Don’t give a thought as to how big or how little
your cast is, or how much or how little your production
is going to cost. If it’s a good play it can’t cost
too much, and if it’s a bad one it can’t help it.</p>

<p class='c013'>9. Get yourself in the habit of reading over all you
have written previously before you start each day’s
work, and as the manuscript grows force yourself to
be more and more critical of what you have done. A
play should consist of at least a hundred thousand
words, twenty thousand on paper and eighty thousand
in the waste basket.</p>

<p class='c013'>10. Don’t worry about how long it is going to take
you to finish your task; it doesn’t matter. Some days
you won’t be able to write at all, and other days you
can’t stop writing. I have written through hundreds
of lunch and dinner hours and thousands of business
and social appointments. Don’t let any one bother
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>you when you are writing or anything. If the ‘phone
rings, don’t answer it, and if your wife rebels, divorce
her. Nothing and nobody is important when the
thoughts are boiling. Nobody expects a dramatist
to be a respectable member of society, and any crime
is justified. If you find yourself bored at your desk
go and play golf, play anything, but stop writing. If
you find yourself in your stride keep at it. I wrote
one entire act of <span class='fss'>THE DETOUR</span> without getting up
from my chair, sixty-five hundred words in longhand
in eight hours. Teach yourself this trick of crawling
into your shell like a mud turtle and letting the world
roll by.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have developed a habit of concentration until it
is an almost idiotic habit. When I have a play in my
head neither time nor space exist for me. I am forced
to keep a car and a man to drive it because I have so
trained my mind to focusing that the moment I sat
back in a seat on the subway it was a foregone conclusion
that I would be put off the train at Van Cortland
Park when I lived on East 63rd Street. For a time
I tried driving a car myself, but no sooner did I find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>myself on a straight road than my mind clicked back
on its job of play making until I drove into a ditch or
ran through a traffic light. At length I was persuaded
to give up driving, not entirely out of respect for the
law, but because the roars of outraged traffic cops disturbed
my train of thought.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some years ago my wife was taken to the hospital
for a critical operation and I spent the most horrible
day of my life awaiting a verdict that meant life or
death. At length I was allowed to see her for five
minutes and told to go home and not to return until
late the following day. Absolutely broken by what
I had been through I returned to our empty rooms;
it was ten o’clock at night; sleep was out of the question.
I sat at my desk making marks on a pad of
paper. Suddenly I was struck by, of all things, an
idea for a farce, and I started to write. Sometime
later I had a feeling of fatigue, and I sadly said to
myself: “I’m getting old. I’m not the man I was.”
Then I noticed that, although my lights were burning,
it was broad daylight outside. I looked at my
watch and discovered that it was two o’clock. I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>been writing for sixteen hours. When Mrs. Davis
came back from the hospital two weeks later I had
written, sold, cast and started rehearsals of <span class='fss'>EASY COME,
EASY GO</span>, and she was rather curious as to where this
stranger had come from.</p>

<p class='c013'>I wrote a melodrama called <span class='fss'>HER MARRIAGE VOW</span> in
three days, many years ago, and it played three years.
On the other hand, I worked eleven months on <span class='fss'>THE
NERVOUS WRECK</span>. Time doesn’t mean a thing. Any
good newspaper man will tell you that if he couldn’t
turn out three thousand words of copy a day he
couldn’t hold his job. A play is seldom more than
twenty-one thousand words, seven days’ work if you
want it to be, seven years’ work if it happens to come
that way.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a matter of fact, I figure that it takes me one
hundred hours to write a play, which, of course, can
be one hour a day for one hundred days, or ten hours
a day for ten days; but please note that my trick is
never to start writing until I have solved every problem,
drawn every character and completely laid out
my story line. The trick of carrying all this in your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>mind with absolutely no notes to fall back upon is
rather a difficult one to master, but it is, I am sure,
of great value. What really happens is that in the
course of the weeks you go about with this junk shifting
about in your head, the sub-conscious part of your
mind does most of your work for you, and when you
start to write it out you will be amazed to read what
your own hand has written.</p>

<p class='c013'>When I am writing, I make it a rule to go over
my story fully in my mind just before I go to sleep
and to start writing the next morning before I have
read my mail or even the morning papers. Very often
points are clear to me that were clouded the night
before, and I find that the part of my mind that remained
active while I slept has been helping me to
pay the rent.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a great difference between inspiration and
imagination, and although I believe in inspired writing—that
is, I believe that some men and women upon
some fortunate occasion write from an emotional
prompting deeper and finer than their conscious mind
could inspire—I do not confuse the mental pictures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>of an imaginative mind with so exalted a word. There
are and always have been two sorts of writers, the
writer who tells what he sees, or has read or thought
or been told, and the writer whose mind is a sort of
old-fashioned kaleidoscope that forms little mental
pictures quite without conscious effort. In other
words, one writer uses trained observation, and the
other has the gift of spontaneous creation. I have
on several occasions seen the story line of an entire
play laid out before me in one flash at a time when
I, to the best of my knowledge, was not thinking of
any such thing at all. I can, on a bet, at any time
close my eyes and shake my head and look up and
tell a story that, so far as I can discover, I have never
for a moment thought of before.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a matter of fact, this very unusual development
of the power of sub-conscious creation is a terrible
nuisance to me, as my mind races along so easily down
any path that I am dragged along after it without
stopping long enough to make sure that this path is
the one that taste and prudence dictate. I often envy
the writer who is forced to stop and build his plot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>brick by brick, but so far as I know I never work out
a story at all. The story comes to me as Topsy came
to an unappreciative world “born growed.” If a story
of mine is challenged by a manager in whom I have
confidence it is no trouble at all for me to say, “Well
then, suppose it went like this,” and rattle off a completely
different fiction. I have never been able to
harness this trick of mine, and often when I have
made up a story in a flash and sold it to some friendly
manager I have gone home and started to write it to
discover that it insists upon coming out entirely different,
and that the manager who loved the first one
has to recall to me the details of the plot I have quite
forgotten.</p>

<p class='c013'>Once about ten years ago I read a play that never
existed at all to a famous manager. I had promised
him a play, and when the time came to deliver it I
hadn’t had a moment to think of it, so I took with
me to his office an old typed manuscript and gravely
read it to him in the rough, a play that I made up as
I went along. The manager liked the play very much,
but when I handed it in a few weeks later he said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>he had never in his life seen so many changes made,
and that he vastly preferred the first draft.</p>

<p class='c013'>11. Keep in mind that no part of a play, and this
is especially true of farce, is effective when it is not
convincing. The more belief you create in your characters
and situations, the greater your success. Truth
in play writing is quite as valuable as it is in life, but,
just as in life, there is a limit to the extent to which
simple truth telling may safely be indulged in. When
Hamlet told the players to “hold the mirror up to
nature” he was quite aware that when they looked
in that mirror they would see a reflection, not nature
itself. In the arts, truth is art, but it isn’t always true.
We value a play either because (1) of its truth, (2)
of its wide departure from the truth, or (3) because
of a romantic desire excited in us that these related
incidents should be true.</p>

<p class='c013'>We, the audience, must follow each step of a play
with full belief in that step, but where the dramatist’s
skill comes in is in being able to make of himself such
a glamorous and subtle liar that what he feels to be
true becomes the truth. It is the same with any of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>the arts of the theater; our skillfully placed lamps give
us a feeling of sunlight, but they are not the sun. The
great actor doesn’t die before your eyes, but he seems
to die, just as he doesn’t live, he only seems to live.
For a while, here in America, we playwrights fell very
much under the Russian influence and rather wandered
about in a fog. “Why?” we asked, “should this
play be a failure? Isn’t it true?” The answer was
of course that the probability is that if it had not been
quite so laboriously true it wouldn’t have been quite
such a bore. Bad smells are true, rainbows are lies.
No man has ever put wisdom into simple and understandable
words better than Shakespeare did and
Hamlet’s advice to the players remains a marvelous
guide both to the actor and the dramatist. “Hold
the mirror up to nature” but show it reflected—a
mirage.</p>

<p class='c012'>12. I have often been asked what was the most
valuable trait in the equipment of the dramatist and
I always answer, “Courage.” I put that ahead of
everything but genius, and genius is to me just an
expression, like “plovers’ eggs.” I’ve often read of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>“plovers’ eggs,” but up to now I’ve never eaten any.
I think I know personally all of the dramatists of
America and many of the best of England. I am sure
that there are more able and talented men and women
writing for the stage to-day than ever before, but
Eugene O’Neill is the only one I know with what I
would admit to be genius. I don’t always like Mr.
O’Neill’s plays and I never like all of any of them,
but there is always something under them that the
rest of us don’t get. To me he is a mile above the
rest of us.</p>

<p class='c013'>Sidney Howard, Max Anderson and, in melodrama,
Bayard Veiller know their business better than he does,
but O’Neill’s plays come from deeper down, not
deeper in his brain as some people think, but from
the depths of the particularly sensitive heart of a particularly
sensitive man. So, leaving genius aside, I
think courage the quality most valuable to the man
or woman who expects to win a place in the very odd
world of the theater where there are no standards at
all, either mental, moral or ethical, and where the
author must of necessity stand alone against groups
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>with different and antagonistic interests. From the
moment an author signs a contract for the production
of a play until that play has lived its life on the
stage, gone through its course of stock company and
foreign productions and been sold “down the river”
and turned into a moving picture, every single hand
that comes in contact with that play is the hand of
a potential enemy. The manager and his staff, the
actors in a group, the scenic artists and the technical
departments all have the power and as a rule they
desire to put in a little something by way of change,
something usually that will be to their advantage and
destructive to the best quality of the work.</p>

<p class='c013'>This of course means fight. An author surely
might as well fight and be licked as to be licked without
fighting, and the method adopted by the experienced
street fighter of getting in the first punch is
most earnestly recommended. There is to all these
groups but one real hope in any play—the hope that
the author wrote something; if he did, they all, manager,
actor, etc., have a chance for success; if he didn’t
they haven’t. Authors of plays, like dentists, are never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>popular; nobody really likes to have them around.</p>

<p class='c013'>Writers are so different in their method that I hesitate
to advise a course that has been very useful to me,
that is to vary the form of writing often enough to
escape the boredom that follows walking over the
same path too frequently. I like to follow a heavy
drama with a farce, and a light comedy with a melodrama.
Of course, one man usually writes one form
of play better than he does another; yet even in an
age of specialists, the good marksman should learn
to handle all the tools of his trade, and no man can
write deep drama without a sense of comedy, and
most assuredly can’t write farce without a definite note
of tragedy.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have always had a lot of fun writing mystery plays,
although a well-built mystery drama represents a staggering
amount of hard work. The formula is a very
exact and very exacting one, and in addition to its
mechanical difficulties the author must not only create
an interest in who committed the crime, but, if he
hopes for success, he must make them fear that some
one character dear to them is guilty. In other words,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>the mystery play in which one hasn’t gone deep
enough into the emotions to make the audience care
who committed the murder is never successful, no
matter how mysterious it may be.</p>

<p class='c013'>Emile Gaboriau was the master of this form of
writing, and to this day we all more or less faithfully
follow his model, although his complicated plot structure
requires more skill and patience than most modern
authors are able to supply. Poe borrowed the
formula, as he quite frankly admitted, and from him it
descended to Anna Catherine Green, whose <span class='fss'>LEAVENWORTH
CASE</span> and <span class='fss'>HAND AND RING</span> are fine examples of
this form of writing. Jumping again across the Atlantic,
we see in the Sherlock Holmes character, and
in Watson’s shrewd “feeding” of that character strong
traces of the Gaboriau style. After these came the
deluge: Bayard Veiller, with his almost perfect <span class='fss'>THE
13TH CHAIR</span>, several of my own and many others leading
up to the endless stream of mysterious murders,
strange disappearances, midnight crimes, haunted
houses, etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c013'>I know hundreds of men who read one at one sitting,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>but I defy any man to write one in less than
one hundred hours of solid work. When I tackle a
job of this sort, my study looks like an architect’s work
room, charts everywhere, on the wall and tables and
even on the floor. I make a chart for each character,
showing exactly where he is, what he says and what he
is thinking of each moment of the play. In this sort of
trick writing, every word one says is extremely likely
to be used against him. Next to rough farce, the writing
of a play of this sort calls for more technical skill
and inventive power than any other form of play
making.</p>

<p class='c013'>The only thing I can add to these scattered notes
about play writing is that no one should allow a failure
to beat him. There isn’t anything at all remarkable
about having written a bad play; it’s been done before
and it’s going to be done again. It’s writing a good
play that is unusual as the man who bit the dog; he’s
the fellow worth talking about. No matter how much
you may be scorned and derided for having written
what you wrote, no matter how sure you may be that
you never again will dare to look anybody in the face—for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>a dramatist’s failure in the theater, for some
reason that escapes me, seems to carry with it a moral
disgrace and a social ostracism—in spite of this you
will get another chance when you get another play. I
have always demanded that each new play of mine
should be judged exactly as though I had never written
one before, and, as I said earlier in this article, the
critic must tell the truth; he may not want to, but if
you really have done a good job he can’t help himself.
Critics, like dramatists, are emotional idiots.</p>

<p class='c013'>Although I remain firmly of the opinion that the
talent of the dramatist, like the talent of the great
singer, actor, painter and musician, is a thing born in
them and not to be acquired by any other than the
chosen few, I know that love and appreciation of the
theater may be taught and hidden talents discovered
and developed. When in my college days I was running
one hundred yards in ten and one-fifth seconds
I often thought that, in spite of the fact that few men
alive at that time had me beaten that time, there were
probably plenty of young fellows in the country towns
who could have been trained to beat it. Every boy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>in the world doesn’t try to run a hundred yards, and
of course many a doctor and lawyer and business man
has been born with the gift of poetry, music, painting
and drama and has neglected those talents or even
been quite unconscious of them. These new classes
of Dramatic Arts in the schools and universities will
catch any submerged talent and bring it to the light
and beside this they will make cultured audiences, and
in the end good audiences will make good plays.</p>

<p class='c013'>Our present bewilderment in the theater as to what
the public wants would soon vanish if we had a public
who themselves knew what they wanted and when
the day comes when we have a large audience ready
to express the growing demand for mature and adult
drama even we laggards of the theater will hasten to
furnish it—we are all of us hungry for success even
to the extreme of being willing to do good work for it.</p>

<p class='c013'>In November of last year a group of Harvard undergraduates,
accompanied by Professor Parker of the
Harvard English Department, called on me, and at
the same time on Winthrop Ames and Lee Simonson
and asked us to help them form a school of the drama
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>in Cambridge. The Harvard faculty seemed unwilling
to provide the desired instruction in the arts of
the theater and since Professor Baker’s withdrawal
there had been no Dramatic Department. Mr. Ames,
Mr. Simonson and I called a meeting of Harvard
graduates at the Harvard Club and asked these boys
to meet us there and tell us their troubles and their
desires. As a result of that meeting the Cambridge
School of the Drama was organized with a board of
governors whose names read like an all-star cast. At
this school students of Harvard and Radcliffe and a
limited number of outsiders may now take courses in
dramatic technique and the arts of the theater.</p>

<p class='c013'>The faculty of the school is composed of Albert R.
Lovejoy, Walter Prichard Eaton and H. W. L. Dana.
The visiting lecturers and board of governors, each
of whom is to lecture once each term and meet the
students for informal talks, are:</p>

<p class='c013'>Lecturers on play production—Winthrop Ames,
Vinton Freedley, Kenneth Macgowan, Gilbert Seldes,
Maurice Wertheim.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lecturers on drama and criticism—Heywood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>Broun, J. Brooks Atkinson, J. W. D. Seymour, H. K.
Motherwell, John T. Williams, Isaac Goldberg, Professor
C. T. Copeland, Norman Hapgood, Prof. J.
Tucker Murray, Owen Wister, Robert Littell, H. T.
Parker.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lecturers on stage lighting, scene designing, etc.—Lee
Simonson, Robert Edmond Jones.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lecturers on play construction—Eugene O’Neill,
Sidney Howard, David Carb, Philip Barry, Edward
Sheldon, Percy Mackaye, Robert Sherwood, S. N.
Behrman, Owen Davis.</p>

<p class='c013'>Lecturers on the art of acting, etc.—John Mason
Brown, Walter Hampden, Elliot Cabot, Robert Middlemass,
Osgood Perkins.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is a list for you! All Harvard men and all
men who have done real work. I can remember when
I was one of three Harvard men in the game. Now
we are getting our new blood from all the great universities.
Walter Eaton told us at one of our meetings
that he had listed over five hundred universities
and high schools in the country that were giving special
courses in the Arts of the theater! Does that look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>like a dying institution? Five hundred schools turning
out each year a flock of boys and girls who, if they
have learned nothing else, have learned to love the
theater.</p>

<p class='c013'>To me that doesn’t spell the end of the theater, it
means the beginning, and I am eager to try to teach
our own little group all I can before they get started
on their own and get so far ahead of me that I shall
have to turn about and study their methods.</p>

<p class='c013'>This school, with its staff of real workers, seems to
me to be about the most practical place of instruction
established since the day when the boy in <span class='fss'>NICHOLAS
NICKLEBY</span> was told to spell w-i-n-d-e-r, and then
go and wash it. I know what meeting and talking
to such a list of men would have meant to me thirty-five
years ago. Among the warm spots in my memory
are meetings I had years ago with Dion Boucicault,
A. M. Palmer, Daly and Percy Mackaye’s famous
father, and these men weren’t trying to teach
me anything, they were trying to get rid of me as
quickly as they could.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>────────────────<br />CHAPTER VII <span class='small'>◆</span> THE DRAMATIST’S PROFESSION<br />────────────────</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>As time went on I found myself fully versed in all
of the troubles that beset a dramatist and armed
against all of them but one. I had learned a good
substitute for patiently waiting for a production by
turning out so many plays that one of them was always
on the fire. I had learned, in a measure, to comfort
myself for the present failure with the thought of a
coming success, but no philosophy of mine has ever
taught me what could possibly be done with a dramatist
on the opening night of one of his plays. I have,
I think, tried everything, and all that I can be sure of
is that the last way of passing that dreadful ordeal was
very much the worst way I had ever experimented
with.</p>

<p class='c013'>Twenty years ago it was the custom to drag a terrified
author before the curtain at the end of the performance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>and entice him into telling the audience how
glad he was that they liked his play, and how grateful
he was to the manager, the director, the actors, stage
hands, ushers and stage-door-keeper. This gracious
speech being received with some applause, the poor
author went home thrilled by this assurance of overwhelming
success, and woke up the next morning to
read that his play was probably the worst catastrophe
of a direful season. This custom of writers being part
of the first night show has gone out—not, I think,
that the authors wouldn’t still be willing to oblige,
but because the managers learned that most of the
shows were bad enough without any added attraction.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some of our more dignified authors a generation
ago used to sit in the stage box in full view of the audience,
but they grew strong men in those days, and
I doubt if there is a playwright alive bold enough to
follow their example. I have tried sitting in the gallery,
staying at home, standing at the back of the theater
after the house lights were lowered, hanging
around the stage alley, going to a picture show, drinking
too many cocktails, and walking around Central
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>Park, but so far I haven’t found a way that wasn’t
awful. This night is the climax of six weeks of hard
work, to say nothing of all the effort put into the writing
of the play; it means a fortune or nothing, fame
or something that is almost disgrace, and the poor
wretch can do nothing. A forgetful actor, a careless
stage hand, or the blowing of an electric fuse can and
has spoiled many a good play, and all that he can do is
suffer.</p>

<p class='c013'>There is no second chance for a play; if its first
night in New York is a failure it is dead forever.
Luckily the first night audience, supposed to be so
hard boiled and over critical, is the easiest audience
in the world to sweep off its feet and the most generous
in their real joy in the discovery of a good play.
Tough they are at first, but the moment they get a
feeling that something worth while is happening they
go along with you with a whoop. I have fallen down
plenty of times, but the kick that has come to me when
I have put one over is worth a lot. Any way I figure
it I am ahead of the game.</p>

<p class='c013'>This first night audience is a very powerful factor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>in deciding the fate of a play, and the “thumbs down”
of the old Romans was no more final than the harsh
laugh that follows some shabby bit of sentimentality
or some bit of hooey philosophy. Many authors and
managers of late are trying to fill their houses on a
first night with a more friendly crowd, thinking, like
the well-known ostrich, that they are putting something
over, but they forget that mass psychology is a
very curious thing, and that if a man puts his doting
mother out in front on a first night he is very likely
to hear her voice leading the first cry of “Off with
his head.”</p>

<p class='c013'>The whole subject of dramatic criticism, either from
a first night audience or from professional dramatic
critics, is a very simple one, but for some reason it is
very little understood. As a matter of fact neither
this audience nor the critics’ notices of the following
day have anything at all to do with the real success
or failure of a play. In the morning you open your
paper and on the dramatic page you read that your
favorite critic saw a play the night before and made
the remarkable discovery that it was worth seeing—so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>did a thousand others at the same time—the fact
being simply that it was a good play. The critics’
praise did no more toward making it good than did
the favorable response of the audience.</p>

<p class='c013'>Of course many plays are in the balance; some persons
like them and some don’t; but there is little doubt
in the minds of trained observers about the really fine
plays, and even less about the really bad ones. A play
comes to life for the first time when it is played before
a wise audience, and their verdict is as a rule both
just and final. A good play can take care of itself,
and any fool knows a really bad one—when he sees
it. Any of us, when we go out and buy a dozen eggs,
is likely enough to get a bad one, but we are quick
enough to gag over it when we try to eat it. The
critic is simply a man who knows a little more, and
usually cares a little more, about the theater than the
ordinary man of cultivated taste, and he has been
trained in a proper manner of expressing himself.</p>

<p class='c013'>What he tells his readers about a new play is first
the truth. This in effect you or I could do as well
as he does: it was a good play. The modern critic,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>however, goes beyond that in his influence upon the
theater by insisting upon an increasingly higher standard
both in writing and in acting, and by pointing out
the virtues or the defects in the performance, instructing
his public in what may fairly be expected of the
modern drama. Naturally there are bad critics, just
as there are bad writers and bad actors, and the bad
ones do harm, just as the bad actors and bad writers
do.</p>

<p class='c013'>The first night audience in itself, although still picturesque,
has changed greatly in the last few years.
Twenty years ago opening nights of any importance
at all were naturally far fewer in number than they
are to-day, and an opening at Daly’s, Palmer’s, the
Lyceum and later at the Empire, drew a brilliant audience
made up of the real lovers of the theater and
the cream of the “four hundred” that then represented
New York society. To be on the first night
list in those days meant something. The first night
audience of to-day is very different. First nights now
are rarely social affairs, and the audience is very much
more of the profession, actors, managers, critics, writers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>and all the moving picture crowd. These, together
with the dressmakers and play agents and scouts from
the various studios on the lookout for screen material,
make up a colorful gathering and they know a lot
about theatrical values even if they lack a little of the
distinction of the old first night crowd.</p>

<p class='c013'>During the years I have been going to the theater
I have seen some thrilling first nights, but I have never
really been one of the regulars, as nowadays if one
were to try to be present every time a new play opened
there would be very little time for anything else. I
recall distinctly some of the great nights when I have
been present, such as the first performance of <span class='fss'>THE
FORTUNE HUNTER</span>, <span class='fss'>ON TRIAL</span>, <span class='fss'>RAIN</span>, <span class='fss'>WHAT PRICE GLORY</span>,
<span class='fss'>BROADWAY</span>, <span class='fss'>BURLESQUE</span>, <span class='fss'>COQUETTE</span> and many more
where a wave of enthusiastic cheering swept the play
into instantaneous success. We of the theater, I think,
when we watch these first nights with an anxious eye,
are apt to forget that the reason a play goes over with
a bang is because it is a good play, or a novel play, or
the sort of play that at that moment is the play the
public wants and the play makes the first night enthusiasm.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>The first night enthusiasm doesn’t make
the play.</p>

<p class='c013'>My years of almost frantic application to my work
had by now resulted in a fixed habit and I found myself
pounding along at top speed long after the necessity
for such effort had disappeared. It is the literal
truth to say that for more than thirty years there has
been no time in which I have not had a play in some
stage of its progress on my desk and in response to
long training, my mind continually drops automatically
into retrospective revery entirely without conscious
direction on my part.</p>

<p class='c013'>I was not satisfied with the work I was turning out
and decided to make an effort to take life more easily
than had been my habit. I remember getting quite
a thrill out of this evidence of my sanity and prudence.
I had not fully realized how fixed the habits of a lifetime
may become and soon discovered how impossible
it was for me to hope to reform.</p>

<p class='c013'>Before I admitted defeat, however, I made really
quite an honest effort and forced myself to take part
in several of the semi-social and semi-political activities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>of the theater. I had always refused any demands
upon my time not connected either with my own work
or with the affairs of the Dramatists’ Guild or the
Authors’ League, but I now turned deliberately to
these rather remote outlets for my energy. For the
first time in my life I tried to make myself believe
that it is as important to talk about work as it is to
do the work itself, an error of judgment on my part
from which my sense of humor rescued me before I
had gone very far.</p>

<p class='c013'>The most interesting of these activities was the attempt
to establish a National Theatre as it was called,
and although the plan failed, I have always thought
the failure was unnecessary. The committee to organize
this National Theatre was selected from the
best men of the theater, the fine arts departments of
the leading eastern universities and the leading social
and financial groups of New York. We were to produce
one play a year with special attention to manners
and diction and show this play at moderate prices
in all of the larger cities of the country.</p>

<p class='c013'>At the first meeting at the Astor Hotel, Augustus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Thomas was selected as chairman and from the start
most of the active work fell upon his broad shoulders.
Augustus Thomas is by far the best presiding officer
I have ever known, and for years it has been my fate
to be obliged to follow him as chairman, president or
mouthpiece of countless societies and committees; but
on this occasion I was content to remain in the background.
I seem to be of use only when there is a very
practical issue, and the National Theatre was a rather
altruistic, rather visionary scheme that seemed to me
to be a little out of my range. To me the thing that
helps the theater most is a good show, no matter who
writes it or who produces it or where it comes from;
and to me a well-written, well-played play, produced
by the commercial theater, is far more stimulating
than an equally fine performance inspired by some
art group. I have always admired Augustus Thomas;
when I first came to New York in the early nineties he
was the outstanding dramatist, and in fact as a writer
of the better type of melodrama no man of my time has
equaled him. Aside from his ability as a writer, he
is a man of real eloquence and of commanding presence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>and his control of any meeting over which he
presides always makes me blush at the thought of my
own abrupt and rather arbitrary methods.</p>

<p class='c013'>Upon this occasion, in spite of the great names on
the committee, Mr. Thomas was given full charge,
and it was decided that the first play to be produced
by the National Theatre should be <span class='fss'>AS YOU LIKE IT</span>,
a decision I heard announced with dire misgivings as
I have always thought it a particularly dull and silly
play. I was naturally afraid, however, to announce
any such radical views in that exalted company. A
cast was engaged and the production opened in due
time before a brilliant audience in Washington.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is an unfortunate fact that even the plays of
Shakespeare that have retained their vitality can only
be efficiently done by players who have been trained
to play them, and in this particular case the performance
was not anything to rave over. In fact the curtain
fell on the first performance with that dull thud
that always announces failure, and the audience was
cold and unresponsive.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Thomas, who had been with her husband
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>through many of his own first nights, and who had
been trained, as all wives of playwrights are, to give
help and comfort to the stricken, hurried backstage
as the curtain fell and found her husband sitting sadly
amidst the scenery of Shakespeare’s famous masterpiece
with his head bowed and a look of deep dejection
on his face. Her maternal instinct fully aroused
by her man’s agony, she stepped tenderly to his side
and putting her arm gently over his shoulder she murmured
bravely: “Never mind, Gus, thank God you
didn’t write it.”</p>

<p class='c013'>There was no reason that I could see why the first
attempt of the National Theatre should have ended
its existence, but the fact remains that from that day
to this I have heard no more about it and I turned
back to my own work with some feeling of thankfulness.
After all, if a man must be mixed up in a
failure, why shouldn’t he have the fun of being responsible
for all of it? and, since a man with a mind
trained to full activity must focus his thoughts on
something, isn’t it better after all that the something
should be the activity he knows the most about?</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>I don’t in the least know how long a writer is supposed
to last. It may well be that my thirty odd years
have been the greater part of my share although I am
sure I should enjoy making it an even hundred, but
I do know that to keep up with the parade to-day a
writing man must keep his eyes wide open and his
fingers on the pulse of the public. This is many times
more true to-day than it was in the years before the
war, but even then the critical sense of the public was
growing rapidly.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the old days a playwright’s plots and characters
were accepted about as automatically as the church
creeds of the time were accepted, and for about the
same reason; the habit of the average citizen of thinking
things out for himself had not yet grown to its
present stimulating proportion. If both the church
and the stage of to-day are placed in a position where
they must fight for their life, surely nothing that is
fine in either of them is in danger. With the bunk
gone the truth will be twice as powerful.</p>

<p class='c013'>It has always seemed to me to have been Ibsen who
sounded the first note of modern characterization in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>the drama. Good dramatists have always drawn good
characters, but the accent upon the character and the
character’s propelling force upon the narrative was
quite different. Hamlet, Macbeth, Juliet, Portia, Rip,
Caleb Plummer, Duston Kirk and hundreds of others
were finely drawn characters, but Ibsen’s Nora not
only lived and moved but she moved the play with
her and her emotional progress marked the progress
of the drama.</p>

<p class='c013'>After the production of <span class='fss'>THE NERVOUS WRECK</span> I tried
very hard to write the play I earnestly wanted to
write, but I couldn’t get it. <span class='fss'>THE DETOUR</span> and <span class='fss'>ICEBOUND</span>
were true plays from my point of view, honest
attempts to do the best work I knew how to do. But
I had a feeling that the American drama should express
a more optimistic note, that it was, or ought to
be, possible to write of life as truly as plays of that
class were trying to write about it, and yet express the
fundamental difference between our lives and the
lives of the people of Middle Europe, whose dramatists
had given birth to the new school of naturalistic
play writing.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>I know, as a sane man of middle age, that the lives
around me are not always dull, drab, base or unhappy.
I was acquainted with a mother, she was in fact a
member of my own household, who had given up a
career for her children and who was neither heartbroken
nor neurotic; her children weren’t idiots, ungrateful
brats or headed either for the gallows or an
early grave. I had seen her make sacrifices for them
that were well made and well worth the making. On
the whole in this world I have seen men and women
reap what they have sown, and I have looked closely
at life with a trained eye for a great many years and
found it good.</p>

<p class='c013'>I wanted to say something like this in a natural,
true and unsentimental way and I couldn’t do it. I
don’t in the least know why it can’t be done, but so
far it hasn’t been. I don’t propose to take all the
blame for this. I’ll admit that <span class='fss'>NELLIE, THE BEAUTIFUL
CLOAK MODEL</span> said that virtue always won out in the
end, but before Nellie’s time that statement had been
made in platitude.</p>

<p class='c013'>It may be that the sugar-coated play has killed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>possibility of optimistic play writing, but I didn’t want
to write about life’s being worth living just to trick
a happy ending. I simply wanted to say that life was
worth living because that is the way I have found it.
I have lived fifty-six years very happily. I have been
fortunate in having the sort of wife and the sort of
children that have added very greatly to that happiness.
I love my work and as a result I have never
had any trouble in making all the money necessary
for comfort and decency. I am strong and well and
those I love are well—why should I write of a sorrowful
world? Yet for some reason every time I tried
to write a true play the note of futility crept into it.</p>

<p class='c013'>I floundered about for the next year or two, turning
out a few plays, most of which I would have described
in the far-off days when I had worked for the
Kentucky Coal Company as “run of the mine.”
<span class='fss'>LAZYBONES</span> had some good points, <span class='fss'>THE DONOVAN
AFFAIR</span> made money, but always I was trying for that
real play that wouldn’t come.</p>

<p class='c013'>The best work I did at this time was a dramatization
of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel <span class='fss'>THE GREAT GATSBY</span>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>The character of Gatsby made a strong appeal to
me, and here was another chance to do a play with
Mr. Brady, who seemed anxious for me to come in
with him once more. The play was really good, and
moderately successful, but here was another time when
the truth was bitter and cruel and hard for the public
to take.</p>

<p class='c013'>Naturally I knew perfectly well when I read this
novel that Mr. Fitzgerald’s ending absolutely killed
any hope of real success, but I have my own theories
about dramatizing a novel, and one of them is that
the dramatist is in honor bound not to cheapen or
coarsen the original author’s story. Gatsby was a great
lover; for the sake of the girl he loved he raised himself
from nothing to wealth and power. To do this
he became a thief. She was unworthy of so great a
love and he died by one of those absurd ironic chances
that saved him from ever knowing her complete unworthiness.
Mr. Fitzgerald knew that for Gatsby
death was a merciful friend, and I felt that I had no
right to manufacture a conclusion that would satisfy
a sentimental audience.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>As a matter of fact, I do not enjoy working on another
writer’s story, but when I make up my mind
to do it I deliberately put myself into that writer’s
place and absorb his mind and style so that I write,
as far as I am able, as he would write rather than as
I would write a scene myself. In the case of F. Scott
Fitzgerald that was difficult, not only because I had
never seen him, but because he was so much younger
than I that his whole mode of thought and all his
reactions to life were absurdly different from my own.
But a faithful dramatist of an author’s work should,
I think, assume that author’s personality and should
force himself into the completely receptive attitude of
the believer who, with his fingers on a ouija board,
lets the pencil go where the spirits direct. The result
of this collaboration was a good play, but not a real
success. I have always known that, if I had cared
to do it, I could have made from this material a
great box-office hit, but as I have said before, I
think that when one takes another writer’s work,
there is an implied obligation not to alter the
mood of it.</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>This feeling is the reason, I think, why I have never
cared to work on a play with another author, and
why I object so strongly to the “story conference” and
the group writing of Hollywood. To me a play is
so essentially a mood and it is so impossible for two
human beings to enter into the same exact mood that
all such collaboration is started under a very real
handicap. I can understand being in full agreement
with another writer upon details of plot and even upon
shades of character but the mood that would compel
certain reactions from the characters, that must of
necessity propel them along the narrative line in a
certain way, could not dominate two writers at the
same moment.</p>

<p class='c013'>I have had little experience in collaboration but in
the writing of screen stories I do know that no matter
how many writers are working on the same job,
only one of them is really doing anything, and, as
there is no established technical form to screen story
writing, all that happens at one of these famous story
conferences is that the man with the most authority
writes the story and the others sit around and talk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>about whatever subject, if any, interests them at the
moment. I can see how two dramatists might work
together to advantage if one were a highly imaginative
writer and the other an expert in form and construction,
one to dream out the play and the other to
build it. In fact I know of several cases where this
method has been highly successful but to me all the
joy of creating would be gone if I was forced to share
it. Good or bad, I want my play to be mine, and the
thrill that has come to me on the few occasions when
I have been able to look at a play and say: “It is good,
and I did it,” has been a rich return for all the hard
work I have ever done.</p>

<p class='c013'>At about this time Mr. Winthrop Ames, as Chairman
of a Committee of the Theatrical Managers,
offered me the position of political head of their association,
the same sort of job as Judge Landis holds in
baseball or Will Hays in the motion picture field. I
had a feeling that my wide experience in all the
branches of the theater gave me some of the qualifications
necessary for this work, and for some time I
seriously considered it. The actors, through Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Frank Gilmour, and the Authors’ League expressed
a desire that I should try my luck, but in the end I
refused. Mr. Ames promised me full authority, but
I could see no way by which this authority could be
enforced. I know the managers very well, thank you,
and any time I ride hard on those birds I want a big
club and the only gun in the outfit. Also I had a
strong feeling that the time hadn’t quite come. A
little later some better man will take that job and save
the day.</p>

<p class='c013'>In spite of my knowing that I was not doing all I
ought to do as a playwright, these were happy and
prosperous years. I was very active in the politics of
the theater and very happy at home. My boys were
growing up. Donald was at Pomfret and Owen at
Choate, and Mrs. Davis and I sold our house in Yonkers
and came to New York.</p>

<p class='c013'>Always when I have the least to do I demand the
most time in which to do it, just as when I am not
writing at all I insist that I can’t live without an elaborate
writing room, although I know perfectly well
that I have done the best work of my life with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>ten-cent pad of paper and the top of a trunk. In
any case, I found the ride to Yonkers too long,
and we once more joined the ranks of apartment
dwellers.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a matter of fact, I have usually found that about
the time a writer starts in surrounding himself with
every luxury in the way of an aid to his work he never
does very much with his swell equipment besides occasionally
showing it off to admiring acquaintances. It
is quite probable that the money he earned to pay for
his elaborate study he earned by writing a play on the
top of a barrel. I myself have worked in all sorts of
places, ranging from a three-dollar-a-week hall bedroom
to a studio library in a pent house in the Park
Avenue section. During the most prolific years of
my life most of my work was done at a desk in the
living room of an apartment with two small boys playing
about on the floor and crawling between my legs.
It is, I suppose, because I have always had so much
fun with my writing that the members of my family
have never stood in any great awe of my labors, and
I suppose the boys saw no good reason why I should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>try to keep an amusing game all to myself, and usually
insisted on being let in on it.</p>

<p class='c013'>Edgar Wallace told me last year that he loved New
York and always had a wonderful rest when he came
here. It was, he said, the noisiest city in the world
and the only place on earth where he couldn’t write.
Personally I can write better in New York than I can
anywhere else, and although I am afraid I demand
more quiet and privacy as the years go past, I am still
quite untroubled by anything less than a riveting
machine.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some rather facetious remarks have been made
about the volume of my production, but this same
Edgar Wallace makes me look like a drone. When
I am hard at work I turn out about four thousand
words a day, usually in longhand, written with the
softest and dirtiest lead pencil that a nickel can buy.
Mr. Wallace tells me that on a good day he dictates
ten thousand words. I know that twenty-three percent
of all the novels sold in England last year were
of his writing, and he calmly threw in three or four
plays by way of good measure. Ever since I dined
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>with him I have laughed with scorn at any one bold
enough to insinuate that I write too much, and I have
been filled with good resolutions.</p>

<p class='c013'>I surely must settle down to work. No matter how
much a man may enjoy his job, every writer in the
world has times when he thinks he is through. It’s
part of the game. We all of us have hours of profound
depression when we are afraid of the future and in
terror of our own limitations. We are sure that no
good story will ever again come to us and doubtful
if we would know what to do with it if it did. This
is natural enough when a writer has just finished a
play or a novel, because, of course, he has put all he
had into it and his mind feels empty. But this mood
often comes at other times, and the best cure for it is
to hang around doing nothing until you happen to
read a fine novel that has just been published or see
a really good play—the right play always sends me
out of the theater walking on air, and I go to bed
tingling all over to wake up the next morning with
a new hope and a new determination.</p>

<p class='c013'>The worst disease, however, that comes to a writer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>who has been at his job for a long time is the awful
fear of being “dated.” Of course it’s hard for one of
middle age to write of life in any other way than as
he knows it, and equally, of course, our lasting impressions
do not come to us after fifty. I fussed for
a while over the fear of getting to be a back number,
and wondered if I could possibly grow to understand
what we were pleased to call “the new generation.”
I found, or fancied I found, a great change in the old
world, until I happened to recall that these changes
had been going on since time began. A very careful
study of audiences convinced me that they still reacted
to an honest emotion, just exactly as they always had
done, and that the only difference in the world around
me was that the old gods had different names.</p>

<p class='c013'>To me, with my conviction that as the world goes
on it gets better and more worth living in, it makes
no difference at all whether it is the custom to say
“Hail! Cæsar!” or “Hello, Cæsar,” and I very much
doubt if any of our changes are very much deeper
than this. We were a sentimental people, as every
race of adventurers must be. Now we have become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>a very practical race, hard boiled, if one prefers to put
it that way. A little while ago we slopped over about
our emotions because that was the custom; to-day for
the same reason we pretend we haven’t any. Of
course our emotions weren’t any greater because we
made a fuss about them, or any less because we now
cover them up. The relationship between men and
women has changed during the last ten years, so had
it changed in the generation before that, and so on
back to the time of Adam, but that relationship then
and now was a thing of enormous interest, and a swell
thing to write a play about.</p>

<p class='c013'>It’s the writer’s business to meet the mood of the
hour, and all he has to do to meet this mood is to learn
to sympathize with it. Just so long as I feel myself
a part of the life around me there is no reason why
I shouldn’t keep on writing, and at present I most
decidedly do feel that. If the time ever comes when
I find myself bewildered and afraid of a strange world
that I no longer understand, I’ll stop—or rather, on
second thought—perhaps I’ll write a play about how
hard it is to understand it!</p>

<p class='c013'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>At this time I stepped out of my job as President of
the Dramatists’ Guild and took the presidency of the
Authors’ League of America. This, as it happens, is
not an honorary position, but comes under the head
of honest labor, and during the long fight between
the Dramatists and the Theatrical Managers’ Association
that resulted in the present Dramatists’ contract,
I served on all of the many committees in addition
to my work as President of the League. I loved
the work; the friendships I formed among the members
of the fighting committees are among the pleasant
and most helpful contacts of my life.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are about a dozen men and women who
mean a lot to me with whom I have worked for sixteen
years to bring about decent conditions for writers.
There are many more than a dozen now who are
working faithfully for the Authors’ League, but often,
when I attend one of the meetings and sit at the
crowded council table, I catch the eye of one of the
old timers and wink pleasantly—we can remember
years when there weren’t enough authors around to
fill the room with cigar smoke. We used to ask one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>another if it was worth while to keep on fighting.
James Forbes always said that this was positively his
last effort, but he always came back; so did the rest
of us, all busy men, not one of us needing the help
of any one to get decent contracts. We were proud
of our calling and wanted to advance its dignity and
importance, and I think that in the end our many
years of hard work justified itself. The American
Theatre is to-day under a temporary cloud. It may
be one year or two years or three years before its old
prosperity returns, but the Dramatists’ Guild is the
strongest and most powerful body of writing men in
the world and there are plenty of strong men of half
my age who are able and willing to keep it as powerful
and as sane and moderate as it is to-day. No matter
what you hear don’t for a moment believe that the
prosperity of our theater is not going to return,—the
theater is safe and it always has been. Just so long as
little boys instinctively pick up a stick and become
brave knights and gallant soldiers, and as long as a
girl child hugs a doll to her breast and becomes a
mother, the theater will live. A combination of circumstance,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>novel inventions, stupidity and greed, plus
lack of leadership and the arrogance of organized
labor, has resulted in sad days for many of us, but the
turn of the wheel is already bringing about changes
and sooner than most of you are yet ready to believe
better days are coming.</p>

<p class='c013'>If, when they come, the men who have been the
leaders of the commercial theater have learned their
lesson, the temporary setback will have been worth
what it has cost; if they haven’t, they will be forced
to step aside and give up their power to those more
worthy to possess it.</p>

<p class='c013'>The sane, simple and practical way to govern the
theater has been pointed out. Three times already I
have served on committees whose object was to consolidate
the interests of actors, managers and authors,
and hand over the authority to a group of twelve,
made up from the men of proved integrity among the
three groups. We who have made a long study of
conditions know that this composite intelligence could
find a way to correct the principal evils that have been
the cause of our loss of public confidence and support.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>Those of the public who really prefer to go to the picture
houses can of course continue to go to them.
Wise men of the theater know that in the end the
picture houses are great incubators engaged in hatching
out new audiences for us and that in a very short
space of time we could have a road circuit beside which
the old Stair and Havlin houses couldn’t cast a
shadow.</p>

<p class='c013'>There are, however, some very definite evils in the
present state of the theater and every one of them
could be corrected or greatly reduced. The regulation
of the sale of tickets has been taken in hand by
a progressive group of managers and will be corrected
if the managers can be controlled, which is a bit like
saying we could do away with evil if there was no
more sin. The unfair and unwise demands of the
unions of stage hands and musicians could be regulated
by an honest facing of facts and a fair presentation
of present conditions. No organization has the
right, or as a matter of fact the power, to go beyond
a clearly marked line; the moment any group’s
demands become unfair there is very little difficulty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>in upsetting that group. It doesn’t demand
an Alexander, it simply calls for a little common
sense.</p>

<p class='c013'>No one of us really wants to kill the goose who
lays the golden eggs. Help from the railroads would
follow an intelligent presentation of our case. Clean
theaters would promptly follow in the footsteps of a
clean administration. Box office reform depends upon
six words spoken by the right man with the right
authority to back his six words up. Help from the
newspapers does not depend, I am convinced, upon
the spending of millions of dollars, but would follow
an honest request for their assistance based upon the
ground of the theater’s cultural and educational value,
always provided that we could show some claim to
cultural and educational importance.</p>

<p class='c013'>The revival of the road, until such time as the turn
of the tide has made that revival automatic, could be
accomplished under wise leadership that would work
for, say, forty decent plays, decently produced, underwritten
by local subscription lists. Any community
of a hundred thousand population will furnish an audience, once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span> they are assured that there is a certainty
of their getting adult entertainment. These aren’t day
dreams; everybody knows them; several times we
have banded together to fight for them. The last
meeting called by John Golden of the managerial
group actually had a real grip on this problem, only
dinner time came around and we all went home. If
some one were to call a meeting of a strong group
of actors, authors and managers, all instructed to sit
there until they accomplished something, I am sure we
would at last be under way—provided always that no
lawyers be allowed at the meeting and that it be called
at a good restaurant.</p>

<p class='c013'>During my two years with the Paramount Company,
my contract reserved half of my time for my
own private affairs and I divided this time as honestly
as I knew how between my duties to the Authors’
League and my writing. By now my son Donald had
finished college and gone to Hollywood as a staff
writer, and Owen had walked out on Professor Baker
at Yale, horned into the theater when my back was
turned and secured for himself the part of the son in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span><span class='fss'>THE BARKER</span> with Dick Bennett in Chicago. This
action of his, so his mother informed me, was the most
dreadful calamity of modern times and would undoubtedly
bring her in sorrow to the grave, but if you
have ever seen her seated in an audience where this boy
is a member of the cast of players, you might possibly
read in her deeply absorbed face a certain smug satisfaction
that would not, I am sure, make you think of
either graves or calamities.</p>

<p class='c013'>I, being of coarser stuff, never for a moment regretted
the fact that these two boys of ours had insisted
upon following in our footsteps; how could they do
anything else? They were born of two stage-struck
parents and had cut their teeth by biting managers
who frequented our establishment. If a child learns
anything in the home circle, how could they help
learning about the theater? Their mother knows a little
about things outside its range, but I know nothing
else at all, not even enough to be ashamed of the fact.
The great happiness of my life to-day is that as we
grow older, the four of us, we grow closer together,
and that I can talk with my sons of their problems with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>the authority of one who knows something about
them.</p>

<p class='c013'>In the fall of 1928 I wrote a play called <span class='fss'>CARRY ON</span>
with a fine part in it for young Owen. My intentions
were good and I am sure he has quite forgiven me.
Later he played in another of my authorship called
<span class='fss'>TONIGHT AT 12</span>, which was one of the sort of plays
often described by Al Woods as “all right, but what
the hell did you write it for?” In both of these, however,
Owen fared better than I, and I knew that he was
fairly started.</p>

<p class='c013'>In 1928 I turned for a change to the writing of musical
comedy and helped a little on <span class='fss'>WHOOPEE</span>, produced
by Ziegfeld with Eddie Cantor in the old Otto Kruger
part, for <span class='fss'>WHOOPEE</span> is an adaptation of our old friend
<span class='fss'>THE NERVOUS WRECK</span>, expertly tailored by Wm. Anthony
McGuire.</p>

<p class='c013'>I also fussed about with <span class='fss'>LADY FINGERS</span>, a musical
version of my old farce, <span class='fss'>EASY COME, EASY GO</span>, and wrote
a show called <span class='fss'>SPRING IS HERE</span> for Aarons and Freedley.
<span class='fss'>SPRING IS HERE</span>, in spite of a good cast and charming
score and lyrics by Rogers and Hart, was only so-so.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>As a matter of fact, Bill McGuire and Otto Harbach
need not worry; they can have the musical comedy
field so far as I am concerned. Of all the forms of
writing I find it the least interesting and the most difficult;
to me it remains a trick like putting peas up your
nostrils, not at all impossible, but why do it? The
mere statement that I soon discovered that the properly
concocted musical show must be dominated by
its score and not by its book is explanation enough as
to why a vain old dramatist can’t rave about this form
of expression.</p>

  <h2 class='c009'>────────────────<br />CHAPTER VIII <span class='small'>◆</span> HOLLYWOOD<br />────────────────</h2>
</div>
<p class='c012'>Of late years I have been jumping between the
New York theater and the studios of Hollywood,
searching for the old spark of enthusiasm that
made our lives so colorful, and I find Hollywood dull
and depressing and the Broadway theater sad and discouraged.
This sounds, I suppose, like the opinion of
advanced age, but as a matter of fact it isn’t. I haven’t
had a minute in the last thirty years in which to grow
old and I share not at all in the pessimism of those
who think the theater is doomed or the optimism of
those who think the talking picture is all triumphant.
I am absolutely sure in my own mind that the theater
will advance and that the talking picture will fall back,
not to ruin, because it fills a place in the lives of so
many people that nothing can replace. But soon now
both theater and pictures will have a clearly defined
audience—a true drama for an audience that demands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>a mature form of entertainment and a fictional entertainment
for the millions who demand a sugar-coating
on their pill.</p>

<p class='c013'>The picture men need not begrudge us this share of
the amusement business because without a prosperous
theater they would be in a bad fix. They are, and it
seems to me they must always be, dependent in great
measure on the theater for their raw material. The
good play does not always make the best picture, but
a produced play is easier to judge than an unproduced
manuscript, and the highly successful play is always
welcome on the screen.</p>

<p class='c013'>Then, too, the best training school for actors is not
the screen but the stage, although screen and stage
acting are very different and the great actor of the
stage is by no means sure of screen success, while a
pretty girl or good-looking boy with no training at all
can frequently do better work than an actor of long
training. In the theater the actor projects his personality,
on the screen the camera projects it—a very
different thing. Still, however, the theater is needed
by the screen and there is no reason for a feud between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>them. In fact, the dangers and the problems that confront
the theater are less complex than those the screen
is called upon to face. We have but one—to do good
plays. I have another silver cup for any one who can
persuade me that a really fine play has ever failed. On
the other hand, ahead of the men who control the
destiny of the talking picture there are many problems,
almost staggering in their complexity. Let me
try to state the vital one, from figures I have carefully
prepared.</p>

<p class='c013'>Twenty percent of the talking picture audience is
composed of children. Another twenty percent consists
of persons to whom the English language is in
whole or in part unfamiliar. Sixty percent of the remaining
percentage consists of those with what we
may safely call immature minds, leaving an audience
to be thrilled, amused and satisfied in which persons of
a fair degree of culture and taste number some thirty
odd percent. If you care to stop for a moment over
these figures, you may find in them the answer to
many of your moments of bewilderment. To satisfy
this thirty odd percent, who do the writing of and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>critical condemnation of talking pictures and at the
same time to thrill this seventy percent who put up the
money that makes them possible, is already a big problem
and it grows bigger every day as the novelty of the
mechanical device wears off, and the suitable supply of
fiction becomes exhausted.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hollywood to-day demands about four hundred
good stories every year, and my third and last silver
cup goes to the one who can list for me four hundred
great stories written since the world began. Just for
fun I tried my hand at making such a list, and from a
rather extensive knowledge of the fiction and the plays
of both the past and the present I was able to get two
hundred and eight. After that they began to fall into
squads with the precision of well-drilled soldiers and
although many of them told the same story very
charmingly it still remained a twice-told tale.</p>

<p class='c013'>I had, reluctantly, agreed to make a trip to Hollywood
the previous spring for Mr. Sheehan of the Fox
Company, and there I had made for Will Rogers an
adaptation of my friend Homer Croy’s novel, <span class='fss'>THEY
HAD TO SEE PARIS</span>, for the screen. As a result I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>signed a six months’ contract starting in December.
My experience with Famous Players Lasky Company
had been unsatisfactory in spite of the real kindness of
Mr. Lasky, and I felt that under the present conditions
an author’s position in Hollywood left much to be desired.
But I had the advantage of an unusual contract
and I had two strong reasons for wanting to see more
of Hollywood. The first reason was that both of my
boys were there, and my wife and I are, I am afraid,
rather too dependent on them and never completely
satisfied unless they are near at hand. Then, too, I was
greatly troubled by the difficulty of forming a fixed
opinion of conditions out there and determined to at
least satisfy myself that I understood them. I had
never been able to see why a writer in Hollywood
should be forced to deliver up his self-respect, and with
it his only chance of being of real value. I saw both
sides of the issue but to me the pressing need of the
only men and women who are trained to write stories
was so great that I thought it my duty, as one who has
given a great part of his life to the effort to improve
the condition of the men and women of his craft, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>make an effort to find out if it wasn’t possible to break
down the barrier that has always existed between New
York writers and the studio executives in Hollywood.</p>

<p class='c013'>Owen was a featured player for Fox and Donald
was a staff writer and stage director. When I left New
York I was pledged to a six months’ stay and had some
difficulty in laying out my future plans with the degree
of exactness that has become my habit; we got away
at length, however, and I left behind me only the remains
of one “tryout,” a farce called <span class='fss'>THE SHOTGUN
WEDDING</span>, produced by Wm. Harris, Jr., for a brief
tour and never developed beyond that point, <span class='fss'>THE SHOTGUN
WEDDING</span> was funny, but not funny enough.
Wm. Harris, Jr., is, I think, the best judge of a play of
any man alive, although his critical judgment has been
developed to the same extent that Sherlock Holmes
developed his sense of deduction, and when it comes to
discovering a clew to a bad play he could give Sherlock
a stroke a hole.</p>

<p class='c013'>Mrs. Davis and I joined the boys on the Coast early
in December and we had a very comfortable and
happy winter. I made an adaptation of <span class='fss'>SO THIS IS LONDON</span>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>for Will Rogers, worked with Sam Behrman and
wrote and adapted a number of stories. I like writing
for the pictures, or at least I want to like it. It is not
at all a difficult form and I can see no mystery in it.
It is just story writing; the difference in technique is
no more different than the step between farce and
drama writing and nowhere near so different as the
dramatic form and the modern method of building
musical comedy.</p>

<p class='c013'>The difficulty with picture writing is and always
has been to get what one writes past one’s immediate
supervisor and unfortunately this depends very little
upon the value of what is written. Nowhere on earth
are there so many totems, bugaboos and fetishes as
there are in a motion picture studio and all argument
is strictly forbidden. “Yes” is the only word ever
spoken in the presence of the great out there, and an
absurdity once perpetrated by executive order becomes
a sacred custom and part of a ritual.</p>

<p class='c013'>As a successful dramatist, I had become accustomed
to having my opinion listened to with respect, and my
judgment on questions of story construction was almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>always final. I have had many differences with
managers, but never heard of any dramatist who at
least wasn’t given a chance to express his views on the
work of his own brain and who was not consulted
upon what was to be written into the story which was
to bear his name. In Hollywood no author is ever
considered to be of any importance at all. He ranks as
a clerk to be put at any little job that comes to hand
and after he has written a story, he never can by any
possibility know what will be done to it before it gets
to the screen. This is the outcome of the old days of
silent pictures when a director took a company out on
location and shot a story that he made up as he went
along, very much as children who give shows for pins
in a barn invent theirs. The talking picture brought
something very like a drama form but the men in
power, who had won their positions by using their
own method, naturally enough prefer to keep on using
it, in the first place because they had been successful
with it, and in the second place because they don’t
know any other.</p>

<p class='c013'>In any study of the motion picture business it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>always well to remember that it is a very wonderful
thing to be able to send a show in a tin can by mail or
express to any location in the world, and that the marvel
of these talking figures was for a long time so great
that only the most exacting worried much about what
they talked about. If, however, the writing of picture
stories is ever to offer any attraction at all to a writer
beyond the very generous salary he is offered, it is quite
obvious that some change must be made in the present
system. Just now no writer could possibly find
any other reason for writing screen stories than the
money he makes out of it, and quite as obviously any
writer with the skill they sorely need can make plenty
of money without going there. Good writers of to-day
are well paid and any man or woman of the reputation
for success that they demand is very likely to be in a
position of financial independence that frees him from
any necessity of surrendering his dignity and his integrity.
To be sure, plenty of writers are there now
and plenty of others are probably anxious to go. But,
as the good ones come to realize the absolutely hopeless
task that confronts them, they will return to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>former tasks, because they must, if they are ever going
to write anything worth writing, preserve their originality
of thought and style. Once they surrender that
they are lost. Then it doesn’t in the least matter
whether they go or stay, they won’t be worth anything
in any case.</p>

<p class='c013'>Hollywood is the strangest and the maddest place
the world has ever seen. It is beautiful; its sunshine,
its flowers, its bold sea coast with the blue Pacific challenging
any beauty of Southern France or Italy, are
really thrilling. It is a beehive of activity, it is the most
cosmopolitan city in the world—and the dullest. For
some reason one comes away from Hollywood with
that impression stamped firmly in the memory. It’s a
bore. Forget this “wild party” stuff. Don’t pay any
attention to stories of the glamour and excitement of
Hollywood. It’s just a dull place, a grand spot for
winter golf, but a wash-out for any mature person who
depends in the least upon mental stimulation; there
isn’t any. The picture business is the second, or the
third, or the first or some such silly number among the
world’s industries, which is probably what’s the matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>with Hollywood and with the motion pictures.
They are standardized, circumscribed, advertised and
circumcised to such an extent that all they can do is
say “Mamma” when you step on them.</p>

<p class='c013'>What is easily the best medium by which to gain the
ear of the world has gained it under the splendid leadership
of extremely clever and tireless business men,
and, having gained it, doesn’t say anything worth listening
to. The picture business in salesmanship, in
organization, in mechanical and technical development,
in direction and in photography is amazing, and
there they stop. They fall down hard on the basic
commodity they are selling; their story product isn’t
good enough. They know this, of course, as well as I
do, but they do not know the reason or at least those
of them who do know the reason won’t tell the truth
about it because if they did, it would mean the end of
their importance.</p>

<p class='c013'>They will tell you that their writers fall down on
them and that is in fact true. I have been fighting
authors’ battles all my life, but I have no defense to
offer for the New York writer of big name and bigger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>salary who goes to Hollywood with a nose turned up
in contempt and takes their money and makes wise
cracks at their expense. I see their side of the case so
clearly that for three years I have been trying to do
something to clarify this situation. The barrier between
real writers and the studios is, I am convinced,
the greatest obstacle to the advance of motion pictures
and the real trouble I can sum up in one sentence:
“The picture stories are not written by authors, they
are written by executives!”</p>

<p class='c013'>During the winter in Hollywood I was a guest at a
dinner given to Frederic Lonsdale, the English dramatist,
by Arthur Richman. Around the tables in that
room were fifty-four very well-known and very successful
dramatists and novelists of New York and
London. These men were there because they were
successful and important men asked to meet and welcome
a distinguished English writer to whom Mr.
Richman wished to do honor. These fifty-four men
have written many times fifty-four successful plays.
They were not dated, worn out, or exhausted old fellows
in their dotage, but men in their full swing—Sidney
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>Howard, Louis Bromfield, Max Anderson,
Laurence Stallings, A. E. Thomas, John Colton, Martin
Flavin, Sam Behrman, and many more of the same
importance, three Pulitzer Prize winners, three members
of The National Institute; surely here was talent
enough to write good stories. These fifty-four men
were almost all of them questioned by me at some time
during the winter and not one of them who had been
writing in Hollywood for over a month could tell me
that he had found it possible to do good work or that
he could see any hope at all of ever being allowed to
write the sort of thing that he had been successful
enough in writing to cause the heads of the studios to
pay him his large salary.</p>

<p class='c013'>I heard stories told not in anger but in honest bewilderment
that would have amazed me had they not
been in line with the mass of information I had been
collecting. Thirteen writers of standing had been
given the same story to adapt to the screen, the idea
being that bits of each would be collected by some inspired
executive and formed into a masterpiece. Of
course thirteen writers can’t write a story any more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>than thirteen cooks can bake a cake. One of the finest
dramatists of our time had been for six weeks working
on an adaptation of a novel and at the end of that time
some one discovered that the rights to the novel belonged
to another company. A fine novelist and a
really distinguished dramatist were making over a
dated and absurd old melodrama, while a very famous
melodramatic craftsman sat in the next office trying
to dramatize a very light and fluffy novel. The best
dialogue writer in America, who is famous for his brilliant
and sophisticated wit, was writing a Chicago
gang war yarn, two very serious men of real literary
taste were working together on a slapstick musical
show, while two famous musical comedy writers were
doing their best with an English drawing-room
comedy.</p>

<p class='c013'>And so it went. These men were well treated as in
my experience all writers have been out there, contracts
are always kept to the letter and salaries are
always paid. The stories these writers were working
on will very few of them ever see the screen, and those
few will be made over time and time again under the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>eye of some supervisor. The assistance of trained
screen writers will be called for and before any picture
results practically nothing written by any one of the
fifty-four men at that dinner will be left. Now I am
going to admit that out of these fifty-four men it is
extremely unlikely that there were five who knew
enough about pictures to be able to write a proper
“shooting script,” but I am not going to admit that
in that room that night there weren’t brains and talent
and energy enough to have written ten times more
stories and ten times better ones than they ever were
allowed to write.</p>

<p class='c013'>If a ball club was formed of the nine best players in
the leagues and that ball club lost every game, the
sporting public would say that it was the result of bad
handling, as of course it would be. If fifty-four men
who have written several hundred good plays can’t
write more than ten bad screen stories in six months
my opinion is that they have been badly handled, and
I see no other sane deduction from the facts.</p>

<p class='c013'>Let me tell you, quite honestly, the usual experience
of a writer who comes to Hollywood for the first time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>not my own experience, but that of practically every
man and woman with whom I have talked. The
writer will be pleasantly and kindly received and a
meeting will be arranged with the head of the studio.
This gentleman will hand him a play or a novel and
he will be asked to read it over, take a few days to
think out a novel treatment of it, and hold himself
ready to be called to a story conference.</p>

<p class='c013'>After a day, or two, or three, or a week, or a month
or something like that, for the studios are busy places
and the executives’ time is valued far above rubies, the
author is sent for and enters the presence. He is naturally
ready with a carefully thought out method of
treatment for the play or story he has been asked to
study and eager to make a good first impression. Before
he can tell his story, however, the executive will
carelessly remark: “Did I tell you the ideas we had for
this story?” The author will naturally reply that nobody
has told him anything at all since his arrival
except that “California is the most wonderful place in
the world, and you don’t really mean to tell me that
New York is still there.” Then the executive will inform
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>him that “they” have some ideas of treatment of
that story and perhaps he had better mention them. It
has been decided not to have the scenes laid in China—“there
have been too damned many of those Chink
operas lately”—and anyway New York background is
sure fire; the girl mustn’t be engaged to be married to
the Unitarian missionary, she’s got to be the mistress
of a side show barker, and earning her living as a high
diver. “Will Hays can talk as much as he wants to
but everybody knows what’s a proper costume for a
high diver.”</p>

<p class='c013'>Aside from that, and a happy ending, nobody wants
to make any real changes in the story. The author, a
bit bewildered but still anxious to make good here,
makes the first concession that results in absolutely
killing any hope of his knowledge and experience
being of any value, as by now his creative power has
been entirely pushed aside; he has joined the ranks of
“picture writers” in five minutes.</p>

<p class='c013'>Armed with the above-mentioned instructions, the
author retires to his office, very probably the first office
he ever had in his life, and starts to work. The studio
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>is always generous in the time allowed, generous in
fact in every way in their treatment of writers, and
nobody rushes our hero who, in the course of time, say,
three weeks, during which he has drawn a salary of
from four hundred to six or seven times four hundred
dollars each week, turns in his completed story.</p>

<p class='c013'>This story is read and another story conference is
called. Here the author meets the director and the
supervisor. Every one of course knows what a director
is. Some persons, however, and I am one of them, do
not know exactly what supervisors are. As Mahomet
was the Prophet of God so supervisors are there to add
to the power and the glory, and their voices are softly
tuned to utterance of the sweet word “yes.” At this
first group conference it is stated that the story seems
hopeless but stout hearts never despair and ideas begin
to be thrown about the room with an ease that amazes
the writer who, owing to the comparative poverty of
his own powers of invention, is quite unable to keep
up.</p>

<p class='c013'>The results of this meeting are a complete recasting
of the story. Now it’s back in China, but with a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>set of characters and a different plot. After three
weeks of story conferences, the director confides to the
author that the trouble with this yarn is the supervisor
is all wet and the best way out of it is for the
author to come to his house at night and they’ll begin
all over again and get a sure-fire knockout.</p>

<p class='c013'>In two or three more weeks of hard work the story
is ready and, owing to the great enthusiasm of the
director, is “sold” to the studio executive and his O.K.
is put on it. O.K.’s are very important, for without
them no picture can be put into production. At last,
however, the story is ready and the date of production
arrives, the author’s story is actually about to be placed
on the screen!—and how! The director, now that the
picture is actually in production, is in absolute power,
and he calmly throws away the story and strings together
an entirely different one that is no more like the
script so gravely O.K.’d than it is like the original one
written by the author. Mad as this may seem it is
actually what is being done in every studio.</p>

<p class='c013'>Some supervisors are good men; they know better,
but standing as they do between the devil and the deep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>blue sea they drift along. Many directors know a
story, even if very few can write one, but the heritage
of power is very strong and men who in the days of the
silent pictures “shot their story on the cuff” bitterly
resent any authority but their own, and write and produce
only the sort of thing that they have learned by
experience how to handle. The great directors,
Frank Borzage, Louis Milestone, Lubitsch, King
Vidor and a few others, know story values when they
read them and have so much pride in their work that
they can, like all strong men, afford to have less vanity.
Directors from the theaters, like the De Milles, and
others of the men who learned values in the library
and the university, know of course the folly of such
childish story building, but in the great volume of
production their share is small. In spite of this the
big man in Hollywood is the director—they are strong
men, tireless, and creative.</p>

<p class='c013'>The ideal screen story will, I think, always be written
by the director or directed by the writer, the only
difference here is in the words. The man who creates
the mood of a story is the author of it, no matter by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>what name you call him. I have nothing but admiration
for the director who can write a story or for the
author who can direct one, but at present all directors
without exception change and re-write every story
they handle and there are one hundred and eight active
directors in Hollywood. I think it fairly obvious that
there are not and never have been and never will be
one hundred and eight constructive story experts alive
at any one time.</p>

<p class='c013'>In any case, at the present writing the director is
king and the writer is nobody. The opinion of the
great of Hollywood as to the importance and the dignity
of a writer was expressed by the head of one of
the large companies who calmly announced during the
early spring that he was about to try a new policy. He
was going to discharge all his writers and engage new
ones selected from men who had never written anything
in their lives, to see if he couldn’t get some new ideas.</p>

<p class='c013'>Aside from the absurdity of sending for a plumber
when the baby is sick, the gentleman forgot that if his
“new writers who had never written anything” had
new ideas they would never in the world be allowed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>use them. At present the motion pictures are an imitative
and not a creative medium and I very much doubt
if the gentleman ever met a new idea in all his life.</p>

<p class='c013'>This is the present system and if its results are satisfactory
to the men who have poured their millions into
this industry then I am just another New York writer
trying to tell Hollywood how to make pictures. If,
however, there is any feeling that better work could be
done, should be done, and must be done if this wonderful
medium is ever to take the place it ought to take
in our national life, if this advance of two hundred
million is to be held and satisfied, then there is one
way to do it, and only one.</p>

<p class='c013'>The answer is very simple, so simple as to make it
seem silly. Put in every studio a real editor with full
authority. There isn’t one in Hollywood, and there
never has been. Such a man could save each of the
four great studios from half a million to a million a
year simply by killing the impossible junk before it
goes into production. Such a man knows writers and
how to make them write. He knows how to make
them earn their salary or how to get rid of them; that’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>his business. It’s folly to say that such men can’t be
had. Every great newspaper has one; so does every
big publishing house; and when they die others are
found to take their place. What they don’t know
about pictures they could learn. Every editor learns
the taste and wants of the public he serves. Bob Davis
sat in Munsey’s office and picked the fiction for five
different publications with five different classes of
readers, and when he couldn’t find the type of story
he wanted, he took a writer to lunch and in a month
he had it.</p>

<p class='c013'>That’s just an editor’s job. It is possible that even
a fine editor might make some mistakes until he
learned the taste of the picture public, but are there
no mistakes made now? What percentage of pictures
produced to-day is satisfactory, even to the companies
who produce them? Think it over! I am one of the
few writers who enjoyed writing for the screen, partly
because of a habit I have of laughing at silly people,
and partly because I love to write anything at all. I
am not of the number who couldn’t catch the trick
and retired in anger and contempt. When I left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>Hollywood in June it was because I “had a play,” and
I have more offers to return there than one man could
by any possibility take advantage of. I am too old a
writer and too deeply devoted to my craft to hesitate
to set down the result of three years of thought. I have
never, in the theater or in Hollywood, sold to any man
my right to free speech or freedom of thought and it
is rather late for me to change.</p>

<p class='c013'>It is a curious thing how, in the amusement business,
history keeps on repeating itself. In the years I have
been a student of conditions in this field, I have seen
the rise and fall of many different forms of popular
entertainment. The great chain of theaters of the
Klaw and Erlanger Syndicate, the Stair and Havlin
circuit of cheap theaters, the once highly popular stock
houses—the Keith vaudeville, the old Columbia burlesque
wheel, the circus, the skating rinks, all of these
sprang into popularity under the guidance of shrewd
showmanship. Their amazing profits drew big investors
who poured their money in, building new
theaters, consolidating chains of old ones, enlarging,
spreading out. Then, long before the capital engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>could earn any real return, the boom was over and the
investing public held the bag. There has never been a
year when more money hasn’t been lost in theatrical
ventures than has been made. I think the reason is
that the men we have called shrewd showmen are in
reality only shrewd business men and the enterprises
started by their energy and ambition have first languished
and then died because these men in every case
failed to learn the rules of the game they were playing.</p>

<p class='c013'>To satisfy and hold the interest of any great percentage
of the public is a big job for a catch-penny
showman. The reactions of a composite audience
might well be studied by scientific minds. Two Topseys
and two Lawyer Marks’s couldn’t keep the old
<span class='fss'>UNCLE TOM’S CABIN</span> shows alive. The old minstrel
shows died of their own unimaginative elaboration;
three-ring circuses only postponed the evil days for
the tent shows where perhaps something new in one
ring might have saved them. You can’t make a business
out of any form of show business that will stand
up beyond the point where the brains are in the business
and not in the show.</p>

</div>
<p class='c012'>In June my contract was up and for the moment at
least I had had enough of Hollywood. Some day
I am going back, but not until I get some real assurance
of going there as I go into a theater, to practice
the trade I have learned. Owen had returned to New
York in May to create a part in a new play with Richard
Bennett. This play, <span class='fss'>SOLID SOUTH</span>, was running in
Chicago for the spring and summer and was booked
to open on Broadway in September.</p>

<p class='c013'>Donald had almost finished his first play, in which
I took as deep an interest and delight as his mother
would have taken in his first baby, had his activities
led him in that direction. I knew this play had real
promise and would soon call him to New York and
that once more we would be united. And so in June
Mrs. Davis and I returned. As I picked up my tools
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>and started to work I knew that the round peg had
slipped comfortably back into the round hole. The
fact that <span class='fss'>WHOOPEE</span> was still running in November
saved me from a sad fate. For thirty years I have had
at least one play produced in New York each season.
I’m going to have one produced for as many more
seasons as I can, more than one if I can, and as good
plays as I can.</p>

<p class='c013'>It may well be that this thing of producing plays
isn’t as wonderful a thing as I think it is, but it’s my
trade. I have served the theater joyfully for a long
time and if a good fairy appeared before me to-day
and offered me the famous “one wish” I am sure that
I should say, “Please, good fairy, I’d like to do it
again.”</p>

<p class='c013'>This doesn’t mean that my life has been all happiness.
No man’s has been. Perhaps it is best that way.
We have had our griefs, my wife and I, our share of
sorrow, discouragement and our happiness, but, if I
may for a moment borrow the flamboyant style of my
youth, as I look back over the tapestry of my life, the
bright spots do not seem so bright as I had remembered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>them, and the dark spots do not seem so dark. The
whole fabric looks rather like one of these old rag carpets
of my mother’s time—woven of bits of crimson
and blue, of yellow and black—blending now in a soft
harmony, softened by time.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
